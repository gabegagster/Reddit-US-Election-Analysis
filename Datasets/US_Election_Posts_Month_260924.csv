It is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. Eastern and last for 90 minutes.  The candidates' microphones will, under rules negotiated between the Biden and Trump campaigns, be muted in the absence of ""significant crosstalk"".

Per [a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/nx-s1-5106660/election-poll-harris-trump-debate), ""Seven-in-10 Americans say they are going to watch the first presidential debate between Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump on Tuesday, and 3-in-10 say it will help decide their vote"".

Tonight's debate is the only remaining presidential-level debate scheduled for this cycle; the Vice Presidential debate between Minnesota governor Tim Walz and Ohio senator J.D. Vance is scheduled for October 1st.

As always, my mom had Fox News playing on the TV. As always, I ignored it and tended to my kids, waiting for the right time to ask her to put on Disney+. 

Im sitting there, nursing my newborn when she suddenly says, I hope youre voting.

I am.

I hope youre voting for the RIGHT person.

I told her I believe I am. That that right person doesnt believe it trying to control my body or my daughters bodies. 

That set her off, she proceeded to yell at me for 10+ minutes about how Kamala is a Communist and how illegals are killing and raping people everyday. I brought up how Trumps a fascist and how there are far more legal citizens who rape and murder people in this country. Deaf ears. 

The whole debate ended with her asking if I was r*tarded. In front of my kids. Who were staring at her in absolute shock and confusion. I told her, if you cannot control yourself, I will no longer be bringing the kids here. They dont need to be exposed to this. That shut her up. 

My brother showed up around this time. Hes the baby and only boy (the favorite). Hes also very liberal. My mom didnt speak another word about the election. 

We ended up leaving an hour later. As Im packing the kids up in the car, my mom apologizes to me. 

Im sorry I upset you. Im just very passionate about this. 

My mom and I have never agreed on politics. Ive been left-leaning since I could understand the differences between the two parties. But its NEVER been like this until that orange fucking asshole came onto the scene. He has turned his followers into a cult, a cult that is willing to alienate family and friends to vindicate themselves. 

Im writing this at 4am because I cant sleep due to this experience. A part of me wants to cut my mom off. It seems the logical thing to do. But the other part of me loves my mother and I dont want to lose her. 

I hate this election. I hate politics. I hate Trump. I hate how he has divided this country with his hateful rhetoric and lies. Fuck him and anyone who believes his shit.

There is a minority of Trump-voters who would like to see another system in place than the current system of democratic values, because they think their values and ideals are more important than democracy. Those who would rather live in a tyranny or other aristocratic system, as long as their needs and values are met. 

The vast part of the republican voters does not want to get rid of democracy - nor is it in their best interest - and are just un- or misinformed about current events. Even if your opinions are generally in line with most of the things Trump stands for, and you're actively opposed to everything Harris stands for, it should not matter since one side does not adhere to democratic values and the other does. I understand that a lot of information that people in the US get is heavily colored in favour of one candidate or the other

All of this has been made especially clear since January 6th; if you support a candidate that attempted to commit a coup d'était, you want to subvert democracy, or you don't have the correct information to make an informed choice.

I'm open to discussion and reconsidering my views if presented with new insights, as ""they're all misinformed or authoritarian"" feels overly simplistic. My perspective comes from observing recent events, but I'm curious to see whether my view is shaped by the news I receive or if theres a more nuanced explanation.

We're all exhausted. Let's be done with the chaos that Trump brings and come together for our great country! There's hope in Harris's campaign! A vote for Harris is a vote for a UNITED nation. 

Some quotes from last night's debate:

Hope for America

Harris: ""I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people, and that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy.""

Roe v. Wade

Harris: When Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe v. Wade, as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. & I think the American people believe that certain freedoms, the freedom to make decisions about ones own body, should not be made by the government.

Jan. 6th

Harris: Donald Trump was fired by 81 million people, so lets be clear about that, and clearly he is having a very difficult time processing that, but we cannot afford to have a President of the United States as he did in the past to the will of the voters in a free and fair election.

Trump is unfit

Harris: [Trumps] former National Security Advisor has said he is dangerous and unfit. His former Secretary of Defense has said the nation, the Republic, would never survive another Trump term. And when we listen to this kind of rhetoric, when the issues that affect the American people are not being addressed, I think the choice is clear in the election.

To add to this point over 200 former Republican presidential staffers, including Dick Cheney, of all people, back Harris. 

Let's look forward and be done with Trump!

[Brung up most recently by Liz Cheney](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/us/politics/liz-cheney-republican-party.html), a lot of conservative Republicans like myself don't feel like they could support the current GOP, or even think that it can recover from the MAGA virus. It leaves a lot of us displaced and without a party to truly call home. I will be voting blue come November, but I don't feel as if I can truly call the Democratic party MY party.  
It leaves me nostalgic for those seemingly long-lost days where Republicans and Democrats could come together in actual, thought-provoking discussion to further the interest of the United States as a whole, not just for themselves and party loyalties.   
I already plan to enter politics and hopefully elected office, and I've been pitching such an idea to a few friends of mine that are also like me: lifelong conservatives who hate Trump with the fiery passion of a thousand suns.    
It has a ways to go in regards to policy, but I have the name down: the New Conservative Party of America  
Whether or not it'll be viable as a third-party option, I'm not sure (probably not, but doesn't hurt to try lol), but I hope it'll attract those moderates/unaffiliated people across the political spectrum.

- Im an American dual citizen. I have been old enough to vote in one presidential election in both countries. For the election outside of the US, I needed to have a valid ID that was issued by the government to all citizens over the age of 18 in order to vote. Having experienced this, calls for voter ID in the US seem totally reasonable to me, with one important caveat. There needs to be a way for American citizens to easily get an ID. Getting a traditional form of ID like a drivers license or passport is not universally accesible, you need to know how to drive to get a license or pay in order to apply for a passport. If you fix this by getting the government to issue voter ID cards to people who apply for free (people without licenses or passports), then I really see no drawbacks to Voter ID policies.

Before the first debate, I read a lot of left-wing blogs which kept saying Biden would trounce Trump in the debate.  At that time itself, I felt that he should not debate Trump because there is no benefit for him and nothing that Trump says will hurt him with his base. In other words Biden has all to lose and Trump has nothing to lose.

The debate went magnitudes worse than I had ever feared and it culminated with Biden, eventually, dropping out. 

 I now see the same thing with people eager for a Kamala vs Trump debate. I stand by my position that Trump has nothing to lose in this and Kamala has everything to lose. Trump could get on stage, crap his pants, and sling his poo at the audience and he would still not lose a single supporter. Granted, he wont gain any supporters from such behavior either . Kamala on the other hand could make a mistake like she did against Tulsi in 2020 and could destroy the campaign as it is. 

So there you have it. Thats my view. Change it.

Donald Trump says he'll release names of a string of high-profile men - said to include several Brits - who visited sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's Caribbean island if he's re-elected in November

Jeffrey Epsteins secret circle of high-profile men who visited his private Caribbean island has been sent into a blind panic after Donald Trump vowed hed release their names. 

For decades, only a handful of men, including the paedophiles pal Prince Andrew, are known to have visited Little Saint James. But now, dozens of the rich and powerful - which The Mirror can reveal includes several Brits who have so far lived under a cloak of anonymity - are now fearful they could be identified if Trump is re-elected in November. 

While appearing on the Lex Fridman podcast in the States, the host accused the former president of hesitating to reveal who visited the island previously. There's a moment where you had some hesitation about Epstein releasing some of the documents on Epstein. Why the hesitation? Fridman asked.

Trump replied: I don't think I had... I mean, I'm not involved. I never went to his island, fortunately. But a lot of people did. The host then says: Why do you think so many smart, powerful people allowed him to get so close?

Trump responded: He was a good salesman, a hailing, hardy guy, and he had some nice assets that he'd throw around like islands. But a lot of big people went to that island. But fortunately, I was not one of them. 
Fridman said, ""Its just very strange for a lot of people that the list of clients that went to the island has not been made public. Trump replied: Yeah, it's very interesting isn't it? It probably will be, by the way. I'd certainly take a look at it. He then added: But yeah, I'd be inclined to do the Epstein.

The Wall Street financier, who was charged with sex trafficking of minors and died by jail cell suicide in August 2019 as he awaited trial, was known to have hosted numerous influential people at his private residence, including politicians, business leaders, and celebrities. 

However, while some names became public due to the flight logs of Epsteins Lolita Express private jet being made public, many arrived unnoticed.

A victim of Epstein has now implored Trump to reveal the names. People are very nervous and highly so. They'll be in a blind panic now, the now 37-year-old told The Mirror. Trumps pledge to expose these names should cause a lot of sleepless nights. Some of these men are incredibly powerful and have gone to great lengths to keep their associations with Jeffrey under wraps. If Trump gets back in, their days will be numbered. He should expose them. I know who I will be voting for.

Last night, leading US attorney Spencer Kuvin, who represents multiple women abused by Epstein, added: While this information would be interesting, I would also like to know how many times Epstein visited [Trumps] Mar-a-Lago. The lawyer was referring to how Epstein was known to have visited Trumps Florida mansion - once being filmed enjoying a party there with the property mogul.

Mar-A-Lago was also where Epstein and his convicted teen trafficker madam, Ghislaine Maxwell, recruited their sex slave Virginia Giuffre. She would later go on to allege she was loaned out to Prince Andrew to sleep with on several occasions by Epstein.
One of Ms Giuffres claims included accusing the Duke of York of taking part in an underage orgy on Little St James. Andrew has strenuously denied her claims against him and insisted he has no memory of even encountering his accuser.

Legal experts have cautioned that disclosing names without concrete evidence linking them to criminal behaviour could lead to significant legal challenges. If Trump releases a list of names, he could be opening himself up to serious risks, said one legal analyst.

Its not just a matter of public interest, its about the reputations and rights of individuals who may be implicated without due process. There is nothing to suggest any visitor knew of Epsteins offending or took any part in it.

"2024-09-17",1726550948,"Obese woman-child president of HOA I'm not a part of had a fatal heart attack while feuding with me ","Just to preface, yes this did take place in the USA. And no I won't say where. I'll include a TLDR as well. I live bordering a former HOA. It shut down about a year ago. My property is the closest one to them, but far enough away that it does not fall in their jurisdiction since I am not on their street. My property is next to their street, and my driveway enters from the main road. The HOA's road is more than a half mile of houses. Some really old, But the street was redeveloped in the 90s or so. And after that, an HOA was started. You go from a country road and then take a right turn, and bam, you're in semi-suburbia. There are large farms on each side of the former HOA road. The oldest houses were among those owned by the HOA board. And there is also an old small elementary school that was converted into a home by one of the board members. And that was also where the HOA had all their meetings.

When I moved into the area a couple of years ago, it was because I'd come into some money from inheritance, and decided to buy a semi-suburban small town property that had been vacant for several years after the previous house that was on it burned down. The land itself was cheap and heavily overgrown with brush. Once cleared out, I had a manufactured home put there. There was even an existing chain link fence with a gate that kept the property lines well divided. I had enough inheritance money to pay for about 50% of all this without effecting my prior savings. And the rest I had to take on a mortgage for. It's just the sort of property I wanted. A little place of my own where I can work remotely. And if I ever have to move, I can probably sell the place for roughly three times what I paid for it. But I hope to stay here as long as I can. I'm the type who likes to stay firmly planted somewhere. And I hate traveling.

I'd only been living in my current abode for a few days when I suddenly began getting trouble from the nearby HOA. The rotund HOA president showed up along with a couple of her board members on a trio of mobility scooters like they were some kinda biker gang. They had notepads in hand and creepy smiles that I can only describe as looking like they already won from the moment they'd arrived. I made the mistake of leaving my gate unlocked, and they just let themselves in. But they quickly learned I was not gonna let them force me into joining their little club. Before I could even tell them to get out, they'd already spread out. The president was giving me a pitch that the HOA was mandatory, and the other two people started telling me about all the bylaws I was supposedly in violation of. One of them being the state of my grass. Which was at the time almost non-existent because the ground had been leveled and re-seeded when my house was set up. I had none of their attitudes, and told them to leave. They refused and said they had a right to be there, and actually stated that my information from real estate that my property wasn't in their jurisdiction was wrong. I told them that was a stupid lie, and to get off my property. They refused to leave, so I had enough and went into my house, then came back out my old 22 rifle I've had since I was a kid, and threatened them with it. It's just a 22, but it's not a small rifle. So it looks intimidating enough

They lost their minds in panic at the sight of the rifle, and actually called the police on me instead of clearing out when I told them to. But the police sided with me after they arrived because the HOA board were all trespassing, and I was was fully within my rights to defend my own property. The stunned looks on their faces were gold when the police took my side, and told them to leave me alone since I was not in their HOA. The president whined about it repeatedly. But it did nothing because the cops also agreed I was not in the HOA's area of control, and they were overreaching their authority. Then they were all then forced to leave. Somehow they thought I'd be a pushover just because I look young. I was 36 at the time, and people still often mistake me for being mid 20s. I had a babyface growing up, and even tried growing a mustache for a while to look more mature. Didn't work out very well.

The HOA didn't quit trying to make me join. At first I was just getting membership applications in the mail. But then they started getting more passive aggressive. One of the board members even waited for me at my gate about a couple of weeks after the first incident just to tell me that my refusing to conform was ruining neighborhood moral. I reminded him I'm not in his neighborhood, and he told me he could have me shunned if I didn't join. I actually laughed at him for that. I bought a country property to be left alone. Go ahead and shun me. I've got my own friends in the nearby city if I want to see them. Then told the guy to stay away from my property. And if he ever trespassed again, I'd have him arrested. Right after that I started getting warnings in the mail for supposed infractions I'd committed. They actually sent me repeated warnings over the re-seeded grass. Did they not understand how newly planted grass grows? It takes a while to fill in. Then it stopped being warnings, and they sent me a long list of fines they expected me to pay. The fines were for me for having a gate, the gate being yellow, preventing mandatory inspection of my land and house, owning a firearm, having a car in the wrong color, my fence being old and rusty (It was already there when I bought the land), my fence being too tall (6 feet), my driveway not being paved (It's gravel), and they didn't consider my recently installed at the time metal shed an approved building. But that wasn't all. There were more fines going back years to the previous property owners, and the period my property sat vacant and overgrown. They actually expected me to pay in total they thirty thousand dollars.

I was especially livid after they had sent me that list of bogus fines, because they'd have had to have trespassed on my property just to know some of the things they were fining me for. Honestly I think they were just making up rules at some point to claim I'd broken them. I walked the neighborhood, and there were plenty of other rusty fences, patchy lawns, gravel driveways, cars the same color as mine, etc. I had to calm myself down with a drink, and then wrote a letter back stating I was not in the HOA, never will be, and would not pay anything to them. Especially not for anything from before I ever even owned the property. I also made it clear their attempts to fine me were blatantly illegal, if not outright fraud, and would not hold up in court. After that, my garbage can was vandalized after I put it out before going to work. It looked like it'd been cut up with an electric saw or something. I called the cops. But there was little they could do with no witnesses.

I had enough and paid a security company to come set up cameras. The HOA board took notice of the work vehicle from the security company as I saw the same two board members who previously harassed me sitting on scooters and watching from the end of my driveway. They clearly took my threat of retaliation seriously, because I got no more fake fines, and my trash can was never touched again. But they still kept sending me membership applications weekly, and even letters practically begging I just join to keep the peace. So I started mailing them back with ""NO!"" written in black sharpie on the envelopes. And even a letter threatening to wipe my ass with their applications before sending them back. And even that didn't make it stop. For a while I could not for the life of me figure out why they were so desperate to make me join. Turned out their elderly woman-child of an HOA president had practically become obsessed with some crazy plan she was calling HOA Zone Expansion. And was making it a hill to die on since the HOA could not legally expand beyond it's street without permission from surrounding property owners. And I highly doubt any of them would agree to join. I was just target #1 because I was the closest. And they wanted to make an example of me.

I just kept rebuffing the HOA's repeated attempts to contact me. Until one morning about three months after I'd moved in, I found my driveway blocked by a large transit van outside my gate. It was the HOA president, and she was blocking me in so she could personally make demands of me. I don't know why she bothered to use her van to block me in. She was already big as a whale, and could have just stood there herself. I even started calling her President Whale behind her back because she was morbidly obese to the My 600 Pound Life level, and often wore blue and white. She had on what I can best describe as a business jacket over a moo-moo dress, hair in a tight bun, big grandma glasses, and a beaded necklace with a big wooden cross hanging from her neck. And I'm not exaggerating when I say she usually had some kind of food in her hands. Like almost every time I saw her. Even during this interaction she stopped to eat. From what I learned of her later, she was a widow. And her husband was an obese person like her, that ate himself into his grave during his 50s. As for President whale. I do believe she had something very mentally wrong with her. But I wasn't sympathetic after what she tried to do to me.

Back to her van blocking me in. I told President Whale to move her damn vehicle, or I'd be calling the effing police on her. She scolded me like an old church lady for my choice of language, and said she didn't have to move because the HOA owns the road. And since I refused to join the HOA, or pay the fines, she was landlocking me in. Even I knew this was very illegal, and asked if she was mental, because I'm not even on the HOA's road. I'm on the main road the HOA road branches from. She refused to listen to me, so I started getting ready to call police. She tried to stop me from calling and claimed she just wanted to negotiate. I told her there was nothing to negotiate. She was blocking me in illegally, and I would be calling cops if she didn't move her van ASAP. But she pretended not to even hear me and said that if I just filled out the forms to join the HOA, all of my problems would go away. Then she went on a ""The HOA is so great!"" sales pitch, and refused to stop till I told her she was trying to act like a mafia boss, and the HOA was the source of all my problems she was claiming would go away. Then I said that all the junkfood she was eating was rotting her brain. She called me a petulant child. I reminded her I was a grown ass man, and she was a hypocrite to call me petulant when she was the one illegally blocking me in to try and blackmail me into joining her HOA.

She had the nerve to say what she was doing was morally right, and for the good of the community. I said back that it wasn't, it was just to satisfy her own ego, and blackmail is illegal. I also pointed out she wasn't being a good Christian by wearing a cross and claiming such lies. She rolled up the HOA forms and aimed to swat me with them. I had enough and finally called the police. Whale started screaming at me to hang up the call while attempting to chase me around and hit me. But the slow pile of blubber couldn't even get near me. After only a couple of attempts, she stopped and started wheezing. And then she started yelling to try and get the police on the phone to think I was attacking her. I called her out for this, and reminded her I have cameras. She immediately stopped and then waddled back to her van a tired sweaty mess. We stared each other down for around 20 minutes while she sat in the side of her van and stuffed her face before the cops showed up. They were initially unsure what was going on because of Whale's prior screaming when I called. But I had video from my dash-cam and my house to show I'd never laid a finger on her.

President Whale tried to make a big show of fake panic, and said I was dangerous. But the police told her to move her van as she was illegally blocking my driveway. She refused and said the road was the HOA's. But the cops said it wasn't the first time they'd been called because of her harassment in the area, and also stated that the road she was currently on, was not the HOA's road. And the road the HOA itself is on, is county owned, not private. Which was news to me. But it meant she couldn't do this, even if I was on the HOA's road. Then she was bluntly told she cannot block access to anyone, and to move the van right away, or be cited. She tried to argue further, so they ticketed her on the spot, and threatened to arrest her and have the van towed if she didn't comply. She gave us all death glares and finally moved the van. I arrived to work about an hour late that day. But with an interesting story to tell.

Not too long later I was served a small claims lawsuit from Whale. She was suing me for the cost of the fine she had to pay for the citation police gave her, and for emotional distress I caused that was affecting her health. I pretty much looked at the letter and laughed, because I was ready to pick that land whale apart in court. But then the HOA tried another dirty move around the same time. I was soon notified by my bank that someone was attempting to put a lien on my property for 30k. The same amount as what the HOA tried to previously fine me. I finally got a lawyer, and the lien was soon canceled because it was groundless. I filed counter lawsuits against Whale and the HOA for harassment. I also personally went to see the HOA board at their next meeting to tell them off for what they'd tried to do, and that I'd see them in court. Whale actually had one of those little wooden gavel mallets, and was repeatedly striking it on the table that she was sitting at. She pounded it on the table while yelling ""NOOOO!"" every time I tried to speak. The rest of the HOA board had to tell her to stop, and even took the gavel from her hand like she was a child that needed a time-out. She went on a tangent about how she was in charge. But the rest of the board told her to she needed to pack up and go home for the day. But she refused and just sat there with her arms crossed and pouting.

I talked with the rest of the board, and they tried to deny any involvement in the past things Whale had done to me. Including the attempted lien, which was only her doing apparently. I called those as outright lies, and pointed out how several of the board members had previously harassed me in person along with whale at my house, and they were also likely the ones who snuck onto my property to write more fines until I put cameras up. Because I certainly wouldn't figure Whale was the one climbing over my gate and trudging around like that with how fat she is. I then said I was suing them for the harassment, fake fines, and attempted lien on my property, and my destroyed trash can if I could prove it. I'd see them in court to take them for everything I could, because they were royally effed! Their faces all seemed to get flushed, save for Whale. She was puffy and red like a ripe tomato. I was then politely asked to leave so they could deliberate.

Not long after that, things came to an abrupt halt. Only a few days after I'd went to see the HOA board, President Whale was found dead in her home from a fatal heart attack. Apparently it had been brought on by stress and binge eating because the board had refused to stand by her, and voted to dismiss her as HOA president after I told them I was suing. I heard she had a full on child tantrum. I only wish I'd still been there to see it. Apparently she begged them to reconsider, and they packed her things for her and made her leave sobbing. She went home, and then died on her couch while binge eating cake. She lived alone, so nobody found her for days. And the morgue had a hell of a time getting her remains out of the house. She was in her mid sixties and morbidly obese with a serious junk food addiction. So she was basically one twinkie away from kicking the bucket at any time.

My lawsuit against the HOA ended when they agreed to settle out of court after Whale's death. They basically blamed everything on her. They claimed the fines and false lien were only her doing. Though I still don't really believe that. But the board wormed out of any serious consequences since it was Whale's name on all the paperwork. In the settlement the HOA paid all my legal fees, repaid the cost of my having to get CCTV cameras installed, and gave me a few thousand dollars on top of all that as a show of good faith. But Whale's family decided they were gonna come after both me and the HOA. They tried to sue both me and them for causing Whale's death. But the judge threw both cases out before they even went to court. I ended up getting a few anonymous threatening letters taped to my gate talking about things like breaking my legs. And the houses of each HOA board member got vandalized too. My mailbox was also ripped up out of the ground in the middle of the night. Joke was on them. I get all of my mail through a PO Box. Sadly I didn't have a camera at the end of the driveway to see who did it. I'd previously tried putting a trail cam there, but passing cars set it off all day and night. So I removed it.

The mailbox was only really there as an address marker anyway. And wasn't hard for me to replace. But tampering with a mailbox, even one that's basically just for display, is a federal offense. It couldn't be proven it was Whale's family that did it, as there were no cameras or witnesses that saw anything, and my mailbox was never found. But Whale's family vandalizing of the HOA board members' houses were all provable as there were cameras there, and those idiots didn't bother to cover their faces when they did all that damage. Some arrests were made, and a lot of restraining orders were filed. Whale's family finally sold her house and left. Guess they weren't stupid enough to go against a restraining order. I just replaced my display mailbox with one from Home Depot, and that's pretty much where the entire mess ends for me.

The whole situation was too much for the HOA though. And the residents passed a motion to shut it down completely. The HOA served no real function for comfort as there were no paid for common areas like a park or a pool. All meetings were held at the house of one of the board members, which as I said used to be a small school. There were accusations of repeated election rigging, as the board had remained the same for a long time, despite the fact they were so hated. And there were threats of an audit too. The board didn't fight the shut-down because they were all on the verge of being removed by force, so they were ready to throw in the towel. A couple of them even moved away. One of which I heard said that I had ruined everything, and the neighborhood was going to hell without the HOA. The former board were all retired busybodies anyway. The only one that's any semblance of liked, is the one who's house used to be a school and the HOA meeting building. They opened the gym room so locals could come in and play basketball on the regular. Their kids love it especially. I've been living peacefully here ever since, and I have actually made some friends. I didn't intend to. But I stopped to talk with neighbors a few times while out riding my bike, and it just went on from there. I've even been invited to a few barbecues and even a birthday party. Life is good.

TLDR: HOA harassed me for months to join. Obese woman-child president tried to fine me for anything she could think of, and even put a lien on my property. And she blocked my driveway by claiming she was landlocking me in. I sued the HOA, the HOA fired the president, the former president died from a heart attack caused by binge eating, then her family went on a revenge rampage, and then the HOA soon disbanded because they likely rigged elections and were threatened with an audit. Neighborhood is much better without the HOA.","fuckHOA",1311,"https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckHOA/comments/1fiqyz3/obese_womanchild_president_of_hoa_im_not_a_part/"

Did one or the other candidate effectively establish a credible plan to appeal to the undecided voters in the swing states?    ","Harris discussed Increasing a tax deduction for new small businesses to $50,000, up from $5,000. Harris also talked of her plan to address the nations housing shortage including increased housing \[3 millions by end of firsts term\]. As well as 25,000 down payments for first time home buyer. Referring to the American Rescue Plans child tax credit increase to $3,600, up from $2,000, and call for it to be made permanent \[occurred once in 2021\]. She also attacked Trump's sales tax \[dubbed tariffs\] and Tax cuts to the super rich. She called her own plan an economic opportunity and the support it has garnered. She said Donald has no plan except for himself and a bunch of grievances.  

She also touched on immigration and abortion rights responding to the questions and blamed Trump \[hand selected 3 Supreme Court Justices\]. She also referred to Project 2025 to which Trump denied he ever looked at it.

On OBAMA Care, Trump said he did not approve of it, but acknowledged he did not have a plan but had a concept in his head about how to replace it. Harris noted he tried to overturn it 60 times.  

Trump promised to enact an efficiency commission to reduce government spending. At the same time, he said he intends to repeal Bidens tax hikes for tackling inflation and end what he called Bidens war on American energy production. He also promised to stop Social Security Benefits tax. Trump said he will create the greatest economy in the world. He stated that under the Biden economy people are dying because they cannot afford bacon and eggs.

Trump appeared frustrated with Harris hard hitting responses and he began calling Harris names such as a Marxist, called her father a Marxist too \[he was a professor of economics\] He added she is letting criminals in.  To which Harris noted she is the only one on the stage who has prosecuted transnational drug dealers, she noted that Trump called his friends in Congress to kill the bipartisan immigration bill for his talking point. Trump's come back was that the immigrants were killing and eating the pets. The panel rejected that as false on the stage having talked to the mayor of the locality at issue. 

Trump was questioned about his mass deportation plan, and he said yes, he would do it sending federal law enforcements, local police and national guard door to door to deport 11 million plus people. He also defended the people who rioted on January 6, 2021, claiming they were singled out. 

He added he had nothing to do with the riot \[he wanted peaceful protest\]. In the end he blamed Nancy Pelosi. Harris in her response held Trump responsible for the insurrection and interjected Charlottesville during the conversation. When asked if he now acknowledges he lost the 2020 election, Trump denied on the stage he ever lost the election though he said, he lost by a whisker earlier during the week.  

As to wars Trump said it would never happen if he were in charge and that he could stop the Ukraine war before he even enters office.  Harris said Trump would just surrender Ukraine and that she believed in Ukraine's integrity and that she supported NATO. As to Afghanistan, Harris asserted Trump made the weakest deal to withdraw.  

On Climate change Harris noted that Trump has called it a hoax. Harris is said to have called it an existential threat and referred to the greatest legislation addressing climate change that the administration passed.  

On question of race and color Harris seemed to have hit a home run and recited Trump's history of race bating. Harris instead talked of unity and strength of diversity and how to help all Americans instead of dividing it...

A lot of MMW predictions are likely wishful thinking. Polling shows mixed results for Harris in swing states. Trump has outperformed polling results in the past. Vance doesn't disadvantage Trump as much as people think, and Walz doesn't advantage Harris very much. RFK split the Trump ticket to Harris's advantage, but most RFK voters will vote for Trump, write in or not vote at all.

The election results will hinge almost entirely on voter turnout and enthusiasm for each candidate. Legal battles for voter disenfranchisement and certification will be the second biggest factor.There will be very few Trump to Harris and Harris to Trump conversions.

Republicans will not face a decisive defeat in Congress and the White House until 2032, when shifts in voter demographics will be too much to overcome for the GOP.

""Are you voting for trump this time or are you choosing hell?""","My mom is a 76 year old masters-degree educated black woman who is somehow, confoundingly, a huge trump supporter. She's been to multiple MAGA rallies, she has MAGA hats in an array of colors, she has donated thousands of her fixed income dollars to his campaign (Over $40K since 2015, at last count).

&lt;&lt;Why, you ask? Because she is a very conservative, fundamental Christian who goes to church 4-6 days a week and views abortion as the biggest crime of this era. She is against abortion for any reason. Even if the mother could die, even if the mother has other living children to take care of, even if the baby's daddy and grandpappy are the same guy.  She doesn't care how the fetus got in the womb, she says. She's had this belief system since the 80s - she was one of those people holding poster boards of aborted fetuses and yelling at patients in front of women's clinics. &gt;&gt;

My mom is a huge fan of Pat Robertson, Jim Bakker, Fred Price, all the big male televangelists from the 80s. She loves trump for the same reasons she loves them. Anyway on to the reason for the post.

We talk less and less during election years, the closer we get to November to avoid conflict. I'm her only child and she's a widow so I do check on her once a week, avoiding the politics topic like the plague that it is. But this week she decided to start the shit with me.

""It's almost time to vote! Are you voting for trump this time or are you choosing hell?""

I asked her some questions in response that pissed her off to the point of sputtering, but at least she got off my ass. I'll share them with you:

""What church is trump a member of, Mom? What church did he attend last Sunday? Or all summer? Or in all of 2024?""

""Trump cheated on all his wives. How many abortions do you think he's had to pay for, over the years, because he can't keep it in his pants?""

""How did you like Trump saying his administration will be 'great for women's reproductive rights"" on Truth Social the other day? How much of your hard-earned, anti-abortion life savings have you given him again..?""

""What does the bible say about the Mark of The Beast? Where does trump ask you to wear his logo? On your forehead, right?""

I guess they don't explicitly say that they're against it, but they're definitely voting against it in Congress. Since these people are obsessed with making every baby be born, why do they dislike IVF? Is it because the conception is artificial? If so, are they against aborting IVF babies, too?

4. ""IVF is an attempt to make up for wasted childbearing years.""
5. Gay couples can use IVF embryos to have children.
6. A broader conservative agenda to limit womens control over their reproductive choices.
7. Focusing on IVF is a way for Republicans to divert attention from other pressing issues.

If you haven't already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.
Recently I was made aware that Al of 'me' falsely endorsing Donald Trump's presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around Al, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.
I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman's right to her own body for decades.
I've done my research, and l've made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters:
Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it's much easier to vote early. I'll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.

Polling gave her an over 90% chance of victory following their debates, but her lead quickly faded. She was knowledgeable about policy but was terrible at strategy and general appeal. She soon squandered her lead through a combination of incompetence and bad luck.

Trump defeated Hillary, then four years later Biden defeated Trump. And all the while, voters were growing exhausted with geriatric, out of touch candidates. Democrats were too timid to move on from Biden in 2024, but he did them a favor and dropped out.

The debate of Harris v Trump is such an absurd matchup that it's completely unfair. Trump is bitter, outdated, and mentally sketchy. He is disconnected from what's real, in terms of how the world works and how to connect with modern political movements. (And he's a criminal but I don't even need to bring that up.)

Harris, like Clinton, can easily win a debate with Trump about politics and facts. But unlike Clinton, she can press this win effectively into real campaign momentum. Trump, on the other hand, has only lost several steps in terms of his competency and reputation.

America came very near to facing an election between two creaky old grampas who should be crafting macaroni art, not national policy. The vast majority of voters never wanted that farce. Now that Kamala is in the race, it will become clear that a change was overdue.

Garland is pretty much the definition of a pick who embodies Biden's style of calm, high-road centrist policy. Many have been disappointed by his lack of aggression regarding the defence of democracy and the prosecution of officials blatantly breaking laws, but I'm not surprised in the slightest. That was never going to be him, or Biden. They're both too status-quo, too establishment. 

One of the largest differences I have noted between the Biden campaign and the Harris campaign is the level of aggression and tolerance for bullshit. Biden was very high-and-mighty and very tolerant. Harris, significantly less so. She is unafraid to campaign with low blows and personal insults, unafraid to call bullshit right to someone's face, and supports a more assertive attitude when it comes to prosecuting a defence of the law itself.

So, MMW, should Harris win, Garland will be one of the very first people replaced, and his replacement will be _noticeably_ more aggressive towards people flaunting the rule of law. I expect multiple subpoenas and indictments against everyone from Senators and Representatives at both the federal and state level, to billionaires like Musk, to local election workers, sheriffs, and police chiefs. I expect to see them being enforced with far greater assertion. I expect to see officials who refuse to comply with legal so poe as simply arrested and thrown in jail until they do so.

I can even see a new Harris DOJ persuing charges of corruption and accepting bribes against multiple Supreme Court justices.

She is more aggressive, more assertive, more confident than Biden.

I imagine my mom feels the same, but she's so far gone that I just don't want to deal with the inevitable rage I'll get for even asking her the question, nor do I want to deal with the personal sadness I'll feel to hear her say it.

When you argue with Trump supporters about him being a rapist, and they start trying to tell you that he's not a rapist, this is a deflection.  Ignore it.  Respond with the hypothetical question of whether they'd vote for him IF they thought he was in fact a rapist.  I think only one conservative I've talked to has ever said no, and the rest have largely deflected and refused to answer, and three have said yes.  But make no mistake, for the vast majority, the answer is in fact yes.


Edit: Despite the number of replies on this post (650 at this point), not a single conservative has responded to say they'd never vote for a rapist.

&gt; Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you havent already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.   
&gt; 
&gt; Recently I was made aware that Al of me falsely endorsing Donald Trumps presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around Al, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.   
&gt; 
&gt; I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. Im voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a womans right to her own body for decades.  
&gt; 
&gt; Ive done my research, and lve made my choice.
&gt; Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find its much easier to vote early. Ill link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.

I'll admit that I was a single issue voter, and my sole priority was protecting the second amendment (even today, it still is a very important issue to me, but I'll explain more later). 

I voted for Trump in 2016 and in 2020, but January 6 combined with Trumps felony business fraud conviction and his sexual assault case were my come to Jesus moments and  this time I'm not making that mistake. 

Trump is a liar, a traitor, a coward, and a criminal. He has no business holding public office ever again. I see the danger that he poses to our republic if he is given power and we need to come together as a country to put a stop to him once and for all (hopefully, though I wouldn't put a 2028 run past him if he's still alive.

This was not an easy decision. And I certainly  have my grievances with the Harris/Walz position on guns, but I recognize 2 key things that I think other Republicans that also don't want Trump back but are also hesitant to vote for Harris don't realize: 

1. Because our republic/democracy and the rule of law are respected under a Harris presidency, any new policies, be it guns or something else, can be challenged in court. If Trump wins, he'll just do whatever the hell he wants with no regard for acting within the law. 
I'd rather fight Harris in court over a policy I don't like than fight Trumps minions in the street over democracy as we know it.

2. What a politician wants to do, what they can do, what you can reasonably expect to happen in a term, what actually happens, and what actually happens that dosent get struck down or limited by the courts are very different things. 

While I know we probably disagree heavily on this, I hope we can work together in the coming months to focus on the immediate threat, Trump. He must never be given power ever again.

Edit: 

People, if you want to try and argue gun policy with me, DM me, and I'll happily get back to you at my earliest convenience, but that's not my intention for my post in this subreddit. I'm here in good faith because Trump sent policy disagreements to the bottom of my list of worries with this upcoming election.

&gt; FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
&gt; 
&gt; August 29, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; **NEW: In CNN Interview, Vice President Harris Says She Will Appoint Republican To Her Cabinet**
&gt; 
&gt; VP Harris to CNN: It Would Be to the Benefit of the American Public to Have a Member of My Cabinet Who Was a Republican
&gt; 
&gt; In a new interview with CNNs Dana Bash, airing in full tonight at 9:00 p.m. ET, Vice President Kamala Harris says she plans to appoint a Republican to her Cabinet, stressing her belief that its important to bring in diverse voices to benefit the country.
&gt; 
&gt; [From CNNs early release:](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/politics/kamala-harris-tim-walz-cnntv/index.html)
&gt; 
&gt; *Embracing her vow to act as a president for all Americans, Harris said in the interview she would appoint a Republican to her Cabinet if elected, though said she did not have a particular name in mind.*
&gt; 
&gt; *Ive got 68 days to go with this election, so Im not putting the cart before the horse, she said. But I would. I think its really important. I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion. I think its important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences. And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my Cabinet who was a Republican.*
&gt; 
&gt; This announcement comes as Republican support for her candidacy grows, including  new endorsements this week from [238](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/26/bush-mccain-romney-trump-harris-2024/74947380007/) McCain, Romney, and Bush alumni, as well as retired four-star general [Larry Ellis](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/abc-retired-4-star-general-200-former-gop/story?id=113163960).
&gt; 
&gt; At the Democratic National Convention last week in Chicago, [the most bipartisan national political event in recent American history](https://time.com/7014233/dnc-republicans-trump/), Vice President Harris invited [multiple Republicans](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/20/politics/republican-speakers-democratic-convention/index.html) who are supporting her to take center-stage to make the case for a Harris presidency, including former Congressman [Adam Kinzinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIYSU5omhqM), former Georgia Lieutenant Governor [Geoff Duncan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eusu8FxV5PA&amp;feature=youtu.be), Mesa Mayor [John Giles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKxec-nJm0o), former Trump White House Press Secretary [Stephanie Grisham](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/former-trump-press-secretary-stephanie-grisham-endorses-harris-convent-rcna167476) and former Trump national security official [Olivia Troye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT6PqNryq0Y&amp;feature=youtu.be).
&gt; 
&gt; While Donald Trump continues to attack moderates and independents, as well as Republicans he doesnt like, the Harris-Walz campaign has made clear that there is a place in our coalition for voters who reject the extremism of Donald Trump and want to put country over party. To bring in those voters, this campaign launched Republicans for Harris-Walz, a grassroots organizing program to further outreach efforts to the millions of Republican voters who continue to reject the chaos, division, and violence of Donald Trump and his Project 2025 agenda.

AS A Granite Stater, a lifelong Republican, and a sitting member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, I deeply believe in American democracy.

Ive served in the State House since 2016. I proudly represent New London and Newbury in Concord and Im a current member of the Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee. I believe in truth, integrity, and standing up for the rule of law  and its clear to me that Donald Trump does not.

In 2020, Donald Trump lost the presidential election, plain and simple. And in America, when you lose, you dust yourself off, get back to work, and try again the next time.

But Trump cant take a loss. Instead, he tried to overturn the election, echoing baseless lies and ignoring the rule of law in favor of his own set of rules.

Thats not how we do things here.

I look up to the presidency of the United States, and I want to vote for a candidate who I know will stand up for our Constitution and honor their oath to defend our democracy.

In Januarys primary, I cast a vote for Nikki Haley because I know Donald Trump would destroy our democracy if reelected and I was not alone  43% of voters in the Republican primary cast a vote against Donald Trump and his extremism.

Donald Trump said he doesnt want the support of Haley voters like me, saying were permanently barred and we dont want them, and will not accept them. Well, Kamala Harris has made clear theres room for everyone in her campaign  including Republicans like me. And shes earned my vote.

Im a Republican, and I dont agree with Kamala Harris on a number of policy issues. But I know she shares my deep love for our country and democracy. I respect her, I believe she has integrity, and I believe she has the fortitude to uphold the rule of law.

I cant say the same for Donald Trump. And New Hampshire knows this too.

So to my fellow Republicans and independent voters in New Hampshire, I urge you to cast a vote on behalf of our democracy  a vote for Harris.

You dont have to tell anyone, although you can. You dont have to speak out, although you should. But when it comes time to vote in November, lets do the right thing and stand up for our country and Constitution.","newhampshire",438,"https://www.reddit.com/r/newhampshire/comments/1f49ygf/republican_state_senator_dan_wolf_supporting/"

What are your thoughts on this, and what do you think about their proposals?","Link to article going into the findings:

* https://www.axios.com/2024/08/28/trump-harris-national-debt-election

The biggest expenditures for Trump would be extending his 2017 tax bill's individual and corporate tax rates (+$4 trillion), abolishing the income tax on Social Security benefits (+$1.2 trillion), and lowering the tax rate for corporations from 21% to 15% (+$600 billion). 

The biggest expenditures for Harris would be expanding the Child Tax Credit (+$1.7 trillion), expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit (+$132 billion) and extending the tax credit for health insurance premiums (+$225 billion). Her plan also calls for raising the corporate tax rate to 28%, which would pay for a majority of her proposals.

Another interesting point is that under Trump's plan, the top 1% would gain a net $47,000 after taxes compared to now. Under Kamala Harris' plan, they would lose an average of $9,000.

And after Ronald Reagan tripled the national debt, George W. Bush added to it after Bill Clinton left him a surplus, and Donald Trump added almost as much to it in his first term as Barack Obama did in two terms, can Republicans still say they are the party committed to lowering the debt with any credibility?","PoliticalDiscussion",375,"https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1fijare/a_major_analysis_from_wharton_has_found_that/"

I was raised catholic (being MX didnt have much of a choice). When I moved to America I started going to a Christian church with my neighbors.

I attended church every Wednesday and Sunday until the age of 19. I never really was all on board, since I would question a lot of things. But I would go because it was what I believe it was expected of me. But I would always say I was a believer more than a follower.

Then the 2016 elections happen and MF Trump comes into play. And he wins, and I see all those god loving people go crazy for a man that is opposite to anything  Bible teaches. 

During this time I was starting college and like I said  I still believe god was real. But was living my life. Like I said if I go to hell it is was it is, as long as Im a good person and treat others well and do not commit any crimes.

Then this election cycle comes up again and its making me question what god lets this happen.
I read a book once from a WWII survivor, saying that if he met god when he died he would ask god to ask him for forgiveness. That what god lets this happen to people.

I am not comparing this election to the holocaust or anything all Im saying is that seeing all Trumpers saying god loves Trump and all has made me lose any faith.

Like im questioning what god lets this happen. People are openly supporting a felon and rapist and a piece of scum and they call themselves Christian.

Sept. 20, 2024


Governor DeWine,

I appreciate your deep commitment to the people of Ohio, and your pride in Springfield is evident. You have shown a strong connection to the community and have rightly celebrated the diversity and work ethic that drives Springfields resurgence. However, as someone who leads this great state, you are faced with a profound challenge: to uphold not just the political alignment of your party, but the moral responsibility you bear as governor.

While you acknowledge the harm caused by the divisive rhetoric of former President Trump and Senator JD Vance, your continued support for them undercuts the very values you champion. Trump and Vances ongoing attacks, which vilify legal immigrants and inflame tensions, are damaging not only to Springfield but to the very fabric of our state. These migrants, as you eloquently pointed out, are legally here, contributing to the economy, and striving for a better life as Ohioans. Yet, they are being used as pawns in a cynical political game, one that has real consequences for the safety and well-being of Ohios citizens.

You are correct to highlight the Biden administrations failures on immigration, but allowing Trump and Vances dangerous rhetoric to overshadow that debate only fuels division and perpetuates harm. In fact, this rhetoric is directly responsible for the vitriol, the threats, and the fear that now permeates Springfieldan Ohio city you deeply cherish.

As governor, your duty to protect the people of Ohio must transcend party loyalty. Your leadership should be guided by what is right, not by what is politically convenient. Condemning the actions of those who threaten the stability and safety of our communities, regardless of party, is not just an act of courageit is an obligation.

Now is the time to stand up against the forces that are stoking hatred and division in Ohio. It is time to reject the harmful narratives perpetuated by Trump and Vance and to lead with the integrity, responsibility, and compassion that the people of Ohio deserve. Your legacy will not be measured by the politicians you supported, but by the leadership you demonstrated in moments of crisis.

The people of Ohio, especially those in Springfield, need you to rise above the noise and reaffirm your commitment to the values that make this state great. They need you to lead not as a Republican, but as their governor.","Ohio",335,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/1fn4bn6/a_call_for_courageous_leadership_governor_dewine/"

----

Host Kristen Welker: ""\[Kamala Harris\] has previously supported Medicare for All, now she does not. She's previously supported a ban on fracking, now she does not. These, Senator, are ideas that you have campaigned on. Do you think that she is abandoning her progressive ideals?""

Sanders: ""No, I don't think she's abandoning her ideals. I think she is trying to be pragmatic and [do what she thinks is right in order to win the election](https://x.com/greg_price11/status/1832778839530820076).""



----- My Commentary ----

I don't think that Universal Healthcare is a negative issue for the voters... polling suggests that a near super majority of voters, 63%, in fact, want it.  However, Universal Healthcare is very much a negative for campaign donors. 

When will we stop chasing donor dollars and start doing what is right for the majority of American's who desire it? How do we force change without some form of direct democracy where we get past the representative layer that fights for campaign dollars versus the will of the people?

When we think of the most powerful position in the United States and the world, the President naturally comes to mind. As the head of state, the commander-in-chief, and a global figure, the President holds immense authority but i feel this is a major misconception because what is direct power without influence...yes the president has alot of direct power in many things especially militarily and is seen as a central source of power but domestically ,a president's power can be almost nothing when a speaker and the senate majority leader is against them

Arguably,these two positions are the most powerful in the entire nation....

The chief justice is another powerful person but I wouldn't really classify him on the level of these two...



&gt;The Speaker of the House: Controller of the Nation's Legislative Agenda

The Speaker of the House holds a crucial position in the U.S. political system. As the leader of the House of Representatives, the Speaker has significant influence over what legislation gets considered. This power to set the legislative agenda means the Speaker can decide which bills are brought to the floor for debate and voting. This ability to prioritize, delay, or block legislation grants the Speaker considerable control over the nation's policy direction.

For instance, during her tenure, Nancy Pelosi demonstrated how the Speaker's role could shape the national agenda. By guiding major pieces of legislation like the Affordable Care Act through the House, Pelosi played a key role in defining the policies that affect millions of Americans. Additionally, the Speaker's power extends to appointing members to influential committees, further increasing their control over legislative affairs.

The Speaker's power over the legislative process means they can set the national agenda in a way that can either complement or conflict with the Presidents priorities.This ability can easily eclipse a presidents power .In a divided government, this can make the Speaker a ridiculously powerful individual in Washington, with the ability to block or advance legislation irrespective of the President's wishes.


 &gt;The Senate Majority Leader- The Gatekeeper of Legislation and Judicial Appointments

The Senate Majority Leader is another position of immense power within the U.S. government. As the leader of the majority party in the Senate, the Majority Leader controls the flow of legislation in the upper chamber. This includes deciding whenor ifa bill gets brought to the Senate floor for a vote. The Senate Majority Leader also plays a crucial role in the confirmation process for judicial and executive branch appointments, including Supreme Court justices.

A notable example of this power in action was Mitch McConnell's decision in 2016 to block President Obamas Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, from receiving a Senate vote. By delaying the nomination until after the presidential election, McConnell ensured that the ....(well you know where this is going) 

The Senate Majority Leaders control over the legislative agenda and confirmation processes can make or break a Presidents ability to implement their policies. By determining what bills are considered and which nominees are confirmed, the Majority Leader holds significant sway over the legislative and judicial branches, sometimes rivaling the President's influence.

&gt; September 10, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; **Everyone Is Saying: Donald Trump Lost It**
&gt; 
&gt; Tonight on the debate stage, Donald Trump showed the American people just how unhinged he is  in his own words.
&gt; 
&gt; Vice President Harris [called him out on abortion](https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1833679452477264278), and it was downhill from there.
&gt; 
&gt; He [rambled](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1833680606682820708) and [yelled](https://x.com/BarryMarkson1/status/1833681055758639437).
&gt; 
&gt; He appeared visibly [angry, disorganized and frazzled](https://x.com/SophiaCai99/status/1833688107092234543).
&gt; 
&gt; He [couldnt lay out a single solution](https://twitter.com/KamalaHQ/status/1833697264671310182) for the American people, because the only plan Trump has is his Project 2025 agenda to raise costs on the middle class and take America backwards.
&gt; 
&gt; Republicans are already calling the debate a [disaster](https://x.com/KellieMeyerNews/status/1833691620274802970) for Trump.
&gt; 
&gt; In case you missed it, key moments from tonight:
&gt; 
&gt; * Trump [again refused to acknowledge](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1833685715202253051) he lost the 2020 election
&gt; 
&gt; * Trump [wouldnt say](https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1833691980632600765) he wants Ukraine to beat Russia
&gt; 
&gt; * Trump [refused](https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1833687702081851784) to say whether he would veto a national abortion ban
&gt; 
&gt; * Trump [yelled](https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1833682371750613103) false [conspiracy theories](https://x.com/justinbaragona/status/1833682688198267202) people eating pets
&gt; 
&gt; * Analysts [pondered](https://x.com/RalstonReports/status/1833681197911900322) whether he was rattled by the Vice Presidents handshake
&gt; 
&gt; * Reporters [noted](https://x.com/BeschlossDC/status/1833687714765398028) Trump seemed unable to even make eye contact with the Vice President.
&gt; 
&gt; * Vice President Harris [told](https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1833687974468297094) Donald Trump world leaders are laughing at him and that they say youre a disgrace.
&gt; 
&gt; * Vice President Harris [told](https://x.com/FrankLuntz/status/1833691796377137209) Trump that Putin would eat you for lunch
&gt; 
&gt; * Trump was [called out](https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1833695273006027161) for trying to divide the American people
&gt; 
&gt; * Trump [flailed](https://x.com/American_Bridge/status/1833695958074380731) when asked about his plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and said he had the concept of a plan and not an actual plan.

Last week was my first VA trip since the rise of Harris and post Trump Arlington photo shoot. In my week there saw one red hat and dude ended up detained. Trump hat wearing dude lost his shit when the other vets were telling him Trump didnt support vets, the vets were at first questioning why he thought it was smart wearing that hat after Trumps recent events/statements about vets, in a non threatening manner. 

Trumper immediately ended up going in on racist tirade about (n-word) Hatians eating cats, then started threatening violence when the group of guys started laughing at him about it. Trumper was unhinged. A group of 5 vets ended up securing him by standing right on him and making sure he couldnt pull a weapon until the cops came out, they were on him immediately after threatening to kill them. Trumper was frisked, cops removing a pocket knife, and ended up walking him inside into a room, though didnt cuff him.

Unsure if the Trumpster was arrested, but not smart to threaten violence.  The guys asking the questions were asked by VA police to not engage others with one of them telling the cops when he sees bullshit hats hes gonna call these unpatriotic shits out.. Cops said nothing more and walked off.

"2024-08-28",1724866629,"Trump Media stock falls below $20 per share, a first since company went public ","The monthslong Trump Media stock slide continued Wednesday, as shares of the company majority-owned by former President Donald Trump fell below $20 for the first time since the Truth Social maker went public in March of this year.

As of 12:45 p.m. ET, the stock price of DJT has dropped more than 75% from its intraday high on March 26, the day the company debuted on the Nasdaq stock exchange.

Trump Media has also lost more than half its value since its recent surge on July 15, the first trading day after the Republican presidential nominee narrowly survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.

A Trump Media spokesperson did not immediately respond to CNBCs request for comment on the stocks latest dive.

Trump owns nearly 59% of Trump Medias stock. Even after losing much of its value, Trumps stake at Wednesdays stock price is still worth more than $2.2 billion  more than half of his on-paper net worth, according to Forbes.

Trump, and other company executives and insiders, are bound by lock-up agreements that have so far barred them from cashing in on their shares.

But the lock-ups are set to expire as soon as Sept. 20, at which point Trump may choose to start selling his shares.

Trump has given no indication that he plans to cash out once he is able to do so. But speculation has flared that he might, especially as Trump Medias latest earnings reports show it losing millions of dollars and generating little revenue.

If he does sell  or if he even appears likely to  investors could lose confidence in Trump Media, a situation the companys own regulatory filings have acknowledged.

Similar to other meme stocks, investing in Trump Media has come to be seen as a way for Trumps supporters to back him and bet on his chances of beating Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election.

But the company has noted that its fledgling social media platform, Truth Social, depends at least partly on Trumps enduring popularity and reputation. Trump, who holds the most popular Truth Social account, has recently started posting more on X, his former messaging app of choice, and TikTok.

The stocks recent slide has also coincided with Trumps shifting political and legal circumstances. Trumps odds of winning the election appear to have narrowed after President Joe Biden withdrew his reelection bid and endorsed Harris as his successor.

Trump Media also announced last month that it had entered into an agreement with investment firm Yorkville Advisors, which could enable the company to issue up to $2.5 billion in stock to Yorkville.

The deal would guarantee access to additional capital, if necessary, to pursue big strategic opportunities as we look to build out our portfolio by acquiring assets and technologies in the Patriot economy, Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a July 3 press release.

The company noted in a separate regulatory filing, The sale and issuance of Shares to Yorkville will cause dilution to our existing shareholders, and the sale of Shares acquired by Yorkville, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our Common Stock to fall.

The company's leadership team said they will do everything to make sure their employees are treated right. Almost every single one of them came into this company, after retiring from UPS with all wonderful benefits, that the Union got for them after 25 yrs of service. None would be where they are now, if it weren't for the Union. As a former Union member &amp; leader, this breaks my heart.

""You did it!

Several weeks ago, many of our drivers bonded together and signed a petition stating they no longer wanted to be represented by IBEW Local 1430. Then, on April 11, one brave driver filed a petition with the NLRB asking for an election. The Company then worked with the NLRB to protect our drivers' rights to vote in a secret ballot election. Before the election, our drivers spent a lot of time getting the facts to understand their rights before making this important decision. 

Last Friday, May 3, the NLRB held a secret-ballot election in our test kitchen. 105 drivers voted and, by a vote of 72 to 33, our drivers voted against union representation. Our drivers decided to put their trust in the Company and our leaders instead of continuing to pay dues to Local 1430 as their representative. Our drivers are now union-free - and you no longer have to pay union dues. 

While we are proud of our drivers for learning the facts and making an informed decision that continuing to have Local 1430 represent them is not in their best interests. It is now time to put your full trust in our Company and leadership team - we will not let you down. 

In the coming weeks and months, managers and leaders will continue working closely with you and working hard to create and execute on a plan of action to earn your trust and address your concerns. 

For those 72 drivers who voted NO, thank you for your vote of confidence in our company and leadership team. That says a lot about our relationships. To those 33 drivers who voted to remain involved with Local 1430, we will do our best to earn back your trust. Please know we are all one team and need to focus on how we can keep improving our culture and operations together. 

We are committed not only to listening and taking action, on the feedback from our drivers, and also reigniting the [redacted] culture and values in a way that resonates with our drivers. We highly value our drivers for their talents, skills, and tenure that they bring to work every day. ""

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Makes me wonder how effective union leadership may have been.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Commenter 2:** Honestly it's likely more of an indication of how dumb and gullible your average truck driver is. I used to have to interact with these people for work and it's insane that we entrust these people with massive machines.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; For some odd reason HVAC and truck driving seems to attract just the bottom of the barrel dipshit. Seems to be the trend on reddit too, you see a brain dead far right conservative take it's going to be someone who's also active on trucker subreddits half the time.
&gt;&gt;&gt; **Commenter 3:** A TON of union workers listen to anti-union conservative propaganda and think they'll be better off without the union. I'm in a major union plant and you see Trump and Let's Go Brandon gear everywhere.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; These people permeate the membership rolls, committees, and leadership positions. Our unions are under threat from within. Our local union FB page is a stream of conservative content or replies.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **OOP:** OMG, this is so true. I was a Union VP for over 10 yrs and a member for over 17. He's already looking for other work.

**Commenter 1:** Putting your trust in your employer is some top tier foolishness
&gt; **Commenter 2:** The OP says that almost every driver at this company are retired UPS drivers. Probably the 72 that decided to leave the union... they already have full Teamsters benefits &amp; pension, so fuck everyone else! They don't want to pay union dues because their pension &amp; paycheck aren't enough..
&gt; 
&gt; Just another case of the senior members screwing the younger members.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **OOP:** Not drivers, the management team is made up of retired UPS drivers (25 yr tenure) who have their full benefits and healthcare. They brainwashed alot of the immigrant drivers to vote the Union out. They'd speak to them in their respective languages and literally just have them nodding their heads.

**Commenter:** You know it would be real shame if 33 drivers went out and found new jobs. I'm gonna bet a nickle that the other 72 get the old you gotta do the extra shifts for no OT. We are family.

&gt; **OOP:** Oh, that is definitely happening. Hubby has 2 interviews already lined up this week.

&amp;nbsp;

[Update](https://new.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1eu1a8k/update_my_husbands_job_convinced_their_truck/): **August 16, 2024**

I said it from the beginning. They were going to start letting people go for BS reasons and hire people at lower wages.

My husband who voted against the companies interest was let go today. They can now terminate you at will. The reason for letting him go you may ask. Complaining about the working conditions since they got rid of the Union.

**Edit: Since I guess maybe I didnt write it correctly, my husband who is Pro Union voted against the company asking to remove the Union. He voted against the best interest of the company. If you read my previous post, youll see the company letter they sent when they asked truckers to trust them.

**Additional Information from OOP**

&gt; **OOP:** Let me explain. When the drivers voted, the results were literally divided by old employees to new hire. The company knew who had voted to retain the Union. My husband is friends with the former steward, whos also a driver. The guys were having a lot of route, scheduling and other problems.
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, once or twice or maybe thrice, they lamented loudly they missed the Union due to the lack of support they now had from the company. All of those guys have been slowly let go: We lost a route (lie) Youre not keeping up like we need you too, while giving the employees extra customers and complaining when they dont get back to base early enough. Not Qualified any longer? No pints, DUI or tickets???? Yeah BS but thats NYC

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter:** Hope he can find a union shop for his next job.

&gt; **OOP:** Im on it!! Im a Union girl all the way.

**Commenter:** If they actually gave that as a reason, there might be a case for wrongful termination, expecially if the working conditions were in violation of any law.

Also, due to that, he might be eligable for unemployment.

&gt; **OOP:** They didnt say that directly to him. Theyre dumb, but not that dumb. But everyone knew. They started getting rid of the drivers that were making a lot of OT. They had restaurants on routes that only wanted the experienced drivers as they didnt have to watch what they did or put things. They went in &amp; usually had to help the inexperienced drivers with theirs. Literally they have maybe 10 drivers that have been there longer than my husband now. The company employs over 150 at this location. Now most of the new guys are leaving as soon as they see how hard it is. Its a revolving door of employees now. He can collect but itll never be the same as his take home was, plus the medical benefits we just now lost.

**Commenter:** So, they voted to dissolve the thing that gave them collective bargaining power to willfully submit to the employer's arbitrary whims? And they fell for that?

&gt; **OOP:** Yup. The letter they gave my husband when the vote passed is up on my previous post. He worked hard with the steward and the longer employed drivers, but the new hires were like more money in my check. >&<ý

""Texas is a red state."" If you ever see or read this statement somewhere, it is based on the map on the left. Because Brewster County (the largest county in TX by area with 6,193 sq miles) had more votes for Trump than Biden (51% to 46%), the media paints all of Brewster County red. Looking at the map on the left, you would say Texas is a red state. But Brewster County cast a total of 4,822 ballots in the 2020 Presidential Election.

The map on the right illustrates how we really select our national leaders. Each county is painted a shade between red and blue based on the margin of victory. And, the county takes up space based on total ballots cast. It is population-based instead of area-based like the map on the left. Area-based does not make any sense at all at the state level. And those top 8 counties on that map on the right show you the real story. Brewster County is buried in that red quadrant at the lower right. Its small because it only cast 4,822 votes. Harris County case 1.6MM ballots in 2020.

The 2020 Presidential Election had the smallest margin of victory by the Republicans since 2000 Bush-Gore. And the margin has decreased in all elections since 2000 except for one. Is it possible TX could be flipped this November? Stay tuned.","texas",234,"https://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/1flcrki/the_real_takeaway_from_2020s_presidential/"

Read it! DO ITTTT.](https://archive.is/2024.08.26-232945/https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/upshot/trump-polls-young-men.html)

&gt;In some ways, this presidential election has become a referendum on gender roles  and the generation with the biggest difference in opinion between male and female voters is Generation Z.

This is one of those ""technically true, the best kind of true"" statements that actually doesn't help anyone understand the issue. What happened, in the reality we all share, is that young women had basic bodily rights taken from them by a far-right supreme court and sprinted ""left"", and young men haven't joined them as quickly.

Are there Gen Z boys who embrace the Amerifash narrative? Of course. But even though the next two lines of the article provide context, the intro to this article sets up a false frame, or at least an incomplete one. 

&gt;Economically theyre getting shafted, politically theyre getting shafted, culturally no ones looking out for them, said Daniel A. Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank, who has [written about](https://www.aei.org/articles/the-war-within-gen-z/) the youth gender gap. Theyre drawn to his message, his persona, the unapologetic machismo he tries to exude.

platforming an AEI ""scholar"" to repeat rightwing applause lines without challenging them? Well, okay, fine, but don't expect me to take you seriously. 

&gt;Im going to talk as a feminist: We do it, when we try to suggest women are brilliant and men are the problem, said Niobe Way, a professor of developmental psychology at N.Y.U. who has studied boys and men for four decades and in July [published](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/667368/rebels-with-a-cause-by-niobe-way/) Rebels With a Cause: Reimagining Boys, Ourselves and Our Culture.

&gt;Conversely, she said, Trump is definitely saying, I see you, I value you, I see your masculinity.

okay, let's cop to the second one: yeah, Donald Trump doesn't see a lot of value in challenging The Masculinity Of Teenage And Early-Mid 20s Dudes. And I will even grant: some people self-identify as feminists on the internet and are super mean about Men In The Abstract!

Now which of these individuals and groups want to disentangle gender roles, and which is committed to upholding them? Which group spends time and effort legislating to make your life actively worse? 

&gt;For men, the last few decades have been [more complicated](https://ofboysandmen.substack.com/p/we-must-pay-more-attention-to-young). The share of men working has [gone down](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300001). Many of the jobs that mostly men did, especially manual labor not requiring a college degree, have disappeared. The share of men without partners is [growing.](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2021/10/05/rising-share-of-u-s-adults-are-living-without-a-spouse-or-partner/)

&gt;As the old script for men changed, some felt as if they were left without a new one to follow.

tough and half-fair! I want to challenge the idea that ""having a script"" is an unfettered good; I understand that it's difficult and lonely to chart our own course instead of ""having a script"", and that can be frustrating to young men. It's hard out there! But life being hard shouldn't mean that we settle into roles that are enforced and inescapable.

&gt;In recent years, as social progress has helped women chip away at centuries of sexism, parts of the movement have seemed to dismiss or even demonize men, with phrases like the future is female and toxic masculinity and books with titles like The End of Men: And the Rise of Women. As Mr. Cox noted, a page titled [Who We Serve](https://democrats.org/who-we-are/who-we-serve/) on the Democratic Partys website lists 16 demographic groups, including women  but not men.

&gt;The ideas show up in broader society, too. American parents, who have long preferred sons, [may no longer favor boys,](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/upshot/americans-might-no-longer-prefer-sons-over-daughters.html) data shows, perhaps because of a sense that boys cause more trouble. The jobs that have been [increasing,](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/18/upshot/how-the-modern-workplace-has-become-more-like-preschool.html) like those involving caregiving, have traditionally been [considered womens work.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/upshot/why-men-dont-want-the-jobs-done-mostly-by-women.html)

okay, fine: Democrats, pander to young men. Everyone wants to be pandered to! Maybe pandering to men-as-a-class will help us launch maga protofascists into the sun more quickly! 

but we have to do the work: you have to step out of yourself for a second and take a good hard think about *why* the Democratic Party identifies ""women"" as a group that needs *serving*. 

anyway, a smattering of thoughts. Would love yours!","MensLib",221,"https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/1f3hp4q/many_gen_z_men_feel_left_behind_some_see_trump_as/"

- Im voting FOR Kamala because shell support Ukraine, not Putin.

- Im voting FOR Kamala because she wont try to divide this country.

- I am voting FOR Kamala because Kamala believes in investing in early education and making college affordable.

- I am voting FOR Kamala because diversity and inclusion make us better, not worse. She also understands that the system still isnt fair for everyone.

- I am voting FOR Kamala because she advocates for criminal justice reform and even voted for the First Step Act.

- I am voting FOR Kamala because she is supporting expanding and ending loopholes on background checks for guns and requiring states to put domestic abuse offenders on a federal registry for background check purposes.

- I am voting FOR Kamala because She wants to fix our border issues with compassion, not with vitriol. Its a lie that she oversaw our border these past four years. In fact, she supported the bill Trump asked Republicans to shut down that would have drastically reduced the flow of people across our borders.

- I am voting FOR Kamala because shes consistently supports policies to protect our environment and tackle climate change.

- I am voting FOR Kamala because she knows that one can support a safe and secure Israel and be anti-terror, while still caring about Palestinian freedom and their own statehood aspirations.

- Finally,  I am voting FOR Kamala because she brings to our American discourse a sense of empathy, compassion and intelligence. She has that Obama-esque way of considering the facts, digesting multiple opinions and reaching well-thought-out conclusions.","KamalaHarris",210,"https://www.reddit.com/r/KamalaHarris/comments/1f8a1bg/people_accuse_me_of_only_voting_against_trump_why/"

"2024-09-11",1726076829,"Witnessed my Moms political wake-up call during the debate","I just have to sayKamala absolutely nailed it last night. Trump, of course, straight up lied and fumbled his way through the whole thing, and Ill admit that Kamala dodged some direct policy questions. But she knew exactly how to handle Trump: by getting under his skin. And it workedhe was clearly rattled.

Most of the people around me, like my moms boyfriend, her friends, my dad, his friends, my uncles, and my grandmother, are all Trump supporters to varying degrees. Some are passionately involved, shouting at Fox News, while others, like my mom, are more passive. Shes always been more of a I dont like either of them type, but then shed echo the usual talking points: immigration, Trumps economy, Bidens competency, and so on. It was all just surface-level supportshe never actually looked anything up for herself, just repeated what shed heard, mostly from her boyfriend.

But last night was different. I turned on the debate, and my mom sat down to watch with me. As it unfolded, she turned to me and said, How do people think hes fit for this? Half the time, I dont even know if he knows what hes talking about.

And then, after Kamalas answer on abortionwhere she talked about women being forced to leave their state for care and being left to suffer because doctors fear legal consequencesmy mom started crying. She felt so strongly about this issue, having been a nurse for the last 30 years. Her previous support for Trump seemed to crumble right in front of me. She now admits how evil, incompetent, and dangerous this man is to our country. She sees that Kamala wants to bring us together, while Trump is focused on tearing us apart. She even admitted that Kamala has a good head on her shoulders and knows what shes doing.

That was such a happy and proud moment for me. Being constantly surrounded by Trump supporters has been exhausting. Its disheartening to see so many people buy into the rhetoric. But last night, Kamala changed at least one Pennsylvania voters mind, and that feels like a victory. I finally feel like Im not alone in my beliefs anymore, and honestly, its such a relief.

Manchin's decision is sad but not surprising. He's a coward. I support nuking the filibuster so that the Senate can codify Roe v. Wade (unfortunately, however, the Republicans are probably gonna take control of the Senate in November, which would make that a moot point).

This presidential election is highly important. If Donald Trump wins, then Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito might retire, allowing Trump to replace them with younger Republican Justices, allowing the Republicans to continue to control the Supreme Court for much longer. So I really hope that Harris wins.","atheism",166,"https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1foq9kw/sen_joe_manchin_iwv_wont_endorse_kamala_harris/"

"2024-09-08",1725828501,"We need to elect a Woman President","Fear. There are many harmless ways to be frightened. Movies, shows, even haunted hay rides. You can even feel a sense of dread about a malignant future. None of these is truly fear though. From our very origins our success has been our ability to work together to solve the complex problem of surviving. Most are familiar with the no one person can make a pencil analogy. If not, look it up. The most basic of our tools requires the complex cooperation of many people. This cooperation, prosocial behavior was a vital tool for our species early survival. We are the descendants of people who endured only by depending on those closest to them. This builds a deep empathy for your community: the importance of we. Why has society, at all points, ejected antisocial behavior; those that mean to harm others. Because our survival depended on empathy. Empathy born often of true fear.

Here in the vast majority of the US, those raised as young men, have very little exposure to this fear. While accidents and tragedies occur, the lived experience of most does not include routine fear. The relative physical safety of their routines is a great achievement for our society. Sadly, this is not remotely shared by the entire population. This occasional brush with danger pales in comparison to the day in, day out experience of every single woman. Fear is not an isolated experience growing up as a woman. The ongoing discussion about meeting a man or a bear in the woods is a perfect example. Alone with a man is, and perpetually has been, a dangerous position for the majority of women. Surveys and polls bear out this incredibly sad reality.

This is a moment of intense division in our country. The most important quality we need in a leader is empathy. The ability to take a moment and understand how someone else feels and what consequences they will experience from each decision. This is the baseline. We cannot be certain that the ego filled men who covet the power of the President have any daily experience with subjugation. Men, who for the most part were alive before 1974, when their sisters and wives and mothers could not own their own bank account. I do not trust that these men have empathy. But if someone grew up in our society as a woman, they understand the importance of we.

&gt; FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
&gt; 
&gt; August 27, 2024
&gt; 
&gt; **Statement on Dr. Phils Interview With Donald Trump**
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone knows how to handle unwell, unstable, rambling guests its Dr. Phil.
&gt; 
&gt; His guest tonight was no exception.
&gt; 
&gt; After exhausting his therapy sessions with Sean Hannity, Trump went on Dr. Phil to do what he does best  complain about his own problems.
&gt; 
&gt; With his mic not muted by his handlers, Donald Trump reached a level of delusion difficult for even Dr. Phil to diagnose.
&gt; 
&gt; **If you missed Trumps rambling falsehoods:**
&gt; 
&gt; * He [trashed](https://twitter.com/American_Bridge/status/1828594800658194671) mail-in voting, which he [called](https://twitter.com/American_Bridge/status/1828592098708226103) terrible
&gt; 
&gt; * He said its okay that he wants to be a dictator on day one because he said it nicely
&gt; 
&gt; * He lied about his plans to raise taxes on the middle class by thousands a year
&gt; 
&gt; * He lied about the fact that he will gut Social Security if he wins
&gt; 
&gt; * He again [ranted](https://twitter.com/KamalaHQ/status/1828590882645213399) about birds and windmills
&gt; 
&gt; ***Harris-Walz Spokesperson Sarafina Chitika*** *released the following statement:*
&gt; 
&gt; As Donald Trumps friend Dr. Phil says, you cant change what you dont acknowledge.
&gt; 
&gt; Donald Trump doesnt acknowledge that his overturning *Roe v. Wade* put womens lives in danger.
&gt; 
&gt; He doesnt acknowledge that he left office with the worst jobs record since Herbert Hoover.
&gt; 
&gt; And he still doesnt acknowledge that he lost the 2020 election four years ago  despite the violent insurrection launched in his name. While Donald Trump refuses to acknowledge the facts, voters know Vice President Harris is the candidate to lead us into the future.

"2024-09-20",1726801544,"Thank You for Saving Me, Destiny: My journey from a pro-Trumper to pro-Harris","TL;DR: I used to be regarded and now I am saved. Thank you Destiny for pulling me from the depths of becoming an anti-American nut-job. Skip to the bolded part if you don't care about how I got radicalized. Otherwise, thanks for reading. It's a real novel...  
  
I'm not the smartest guy, but I like to think that what I believe is the truth. I hate being wrong, and I really hate feeling like I've been fooled into thinking something that isn't true.

I grew up default-liberal. Everyone in my community was (parents, teachers, etc.), so I adopted the beliefs. In the first election I was allowed to vote in (2008), I voted for Obama. I liked what he said he would do and I liked that he would be the first black president of the USA. Then I felt like he didn't do the things that he said he would do, I was very against the PATRIOT act and I felt like he didn't do anything to repeal it. I also didn't like the tax penalty from Obamacare because I was a young, poor, healthy guy who didn't really need health insurance. I started to listen to Phiilip DeFranco every day and it made me feel pretty center-left.

I voted third party in 2012 because I just didn't like that I felt lied to by ""the establishment."" I also stopped listening to Philip DeFranco (he had a couple takes that he was factually wrong on) and started listening to Tim Pool... Yeah, I know... I felt like his background as an on-the-ground journalist made him more believable, and then I unquestioningly started consuming his content.

The next election was Hillary vs Trump. I saw Hillary as an ""establishment"" plant. Another political dynasty. I liked Bernie, but I felt like the DNC and the ""establishment"" stole the nomination from him. I was so frustrated with the Democrat party at this point that I said fuck it and voted third party again. I wanted the Democrat party to know they couldn't just keep fucking with us and doing whatever they wanted. Then, when Trump got in, I was really happy that the tax penalty from Obamacare was struck down/voted out. This is around the time I started listening to Steven Crowder and Ben Shapiro daily... Oof...

With the massive amount of disinformation that I was unquestioningly consuming every day, I got more and more radicalized against the ""establishment."" I was convinced that there was some kind of secret government (the deep state) that really pulled the strings, and that Trump was a legitimate threat to their power. With that belief, I was able to write off any criticism of him as deep state, Soros/WEF funded propaganda. Every criticism was just BS.

Then the pandemic happened and I unquestioningly believed that it was blown out of proportion to hurt Trump. I believed in Hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin, all of it. I dodged the vaccine because I thought it was going to kill everyone or something, and since I lived in a deep blue area that decision disconnected me from my community. People started requiring proof of vaccination, proof of testing, etc. My choices had led me to find like-minded people in my area to hang out with, or to find establishments where my beliefs were catered to. It was a weird time where I felt like my echo-chamber got reinforced in the real world. Luckily, I still viewed the Q people/Alex Jones as completely regarded...  
  
BLM happened around this time too, and that made me even more radicalized, and even a little racist. I hated that the downtown in my city was ground-zero for violent protests, that local businesses had to board their windows in order to thwart vandalism and theft. I hated that the police seemed cucked and that violent rioters weren't getting charged. I was so angry all the time... I'm a criminal justice major, and I have never had a negative interaction with a police officer. I couldn't imagine how people were against the institution of policing in the country. Obviously there are bad apples (probably the worst of those in my memory was the Daniel Shaver shooting), but I felt like ACAB was BS. I felt like BLM was being weaponized by the ""establishment"" to hurt Trump, and I hated it.

Then there was the election VS Biden... I hated Biden. Still do to some extent. I thought he was far more senile than Trump ever was, and I felt like he was another ""establishment"" stooge, given his long time working in government and wide variety of positions through the years. I felt like the Democrats were fucking with us again. They didn't learn the lessons from Hillary, and I wanted to stick it to the Democrats and vote for Trump. Separately, I got tired of listening to Tim Pool around this time because he was constantly talking about ""Civil War"" and I didn't believe that was an actual threat.

Up until recently, I though that Jan 6th was just a nasty riot. I completely fell for the doctored video of ballots in a box under the table, and unquestioningly believed the other conspiracies about the voting machines, ballot harvesting, illegal votes, etc. People (rightfully, I thought) were mad about the election and wanted to have their voices heard. I was under the impression that the mob just became unruly and started rioting. For a while, I thought the election was actually stolen. I thought Sydney Powell would come through with the Kraken and suddenly Trump would be the real president...

Then Steven Crowder took a bunch of donations in order to put together a documentary about the stolen election. He said he was going to Arizona to do a big investigation into illegal voting. The he just... disappeared with the money... I lost a lot of faith and started thinking he was a grifter. I stopped listening, and then just fell into a sort of nihilism. ""The entire country is lost, who even cares. Just riding it out until the end I guess..."" I was very depressed. This is around the same time that I got divorced. I don't blame her at all, frankly. I was miserable, hateful, brainwashed, drunk, and politically adrift. I started listening to Steve Deace a little bit around here, but he was too religious for my tastes.

I started questioning all of the lawsuits, why else would they go after a former president unless it was to keep him from getting into office again? (Except, there were really good reasons to keep him out of office... I just wasn't being presented with them, or I was writing them off as more BS...) In my mind, it seemed like a scared political establishment trying to thwart a threat to its power... I was fully into accelerationism at this point. Practically becoming a prepper...

**Then I saw Destiny debate Shapiro on Lex's podcast.** I was interested in watching Shapiro trounce this idiot, and instead I saw someone that I thought was authoritative get completely destroyed by Destiny... I was amazed... I went down a rabbit hole and started listening to Destiny debates daily. I watched him debate nearly every talking head or every talking point that I had believed before, and he DESTROYED them all... I can't even really describe how it felt. Every video I watched, I felt more in touch with reality. I felt like I was getting closer to the actual truth. I liked that Destiny admits when he's wrong, admits when he's out of his depth, hedges appropriately, and actively shows his work and increases his knowledge on topics that he isn't strong on. It was honestly inspiring... I told the people around me that I was watching Destiny's content and the reaction was... weird... They all had bad things to say about him, but nothing of substance... (""He's a cuck."" Okay... ""He's a liar."" About what? And so on.) His takes on Israel, Russia, the USA, democracy, the election, the Pandemic, just everything... They all make sense to me. I don't have any better arguments, and I haven't heard any either.

He opened my eyes about Jan 6th... I had no idea it was so bad... The false elector plot? What the fuck? Pence deciding the election? Insane! Trump is absolutely a threat to democracy! The Republicans are a cult... I've never felt so stupid... While I might not think that Kamala is the perfect person for president, we absolutely cannot have Trump in office ever again. Even though I know that my vote in a deep-blue state doesn't help electorally, I think showing a Kamala landslide (both electorally and popularly) will hurt the possibility of a future Trump figure.

I've unfollowed, unsubscribed, and unfriended a lot of accounts/people. I'm not interested in playing into the delusion any more, or the hate. I don't even want to see it in my feeds. I even dropped my streaming group because I realized they were racist, conspiracy theorists and I've told them that I don't want to associate with them any more.

I am so much less depressed than I was before. I have hope for the future, for America. I feel like a member of my community again. I don't drink like I used to. I don't think everything is rigged by some secret cabal. I am in a wonderful relationship again. I want to get into political activism, and I want to help the misguided people who think like I used to.

I don't owe it all to Destiny, but I don't think I could have gotten here without his content. It was like a ladder dropped into the ideological hole that I had put myself in.

Thank you, Destiny. Not to be even more cringe, but I think you saved my life.","Destiny",118,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1fl2fc0/thank_you_for_saving_me_destiny_my_journey_from_a/"

We've all seen/heard Trump before, none of what he did or said was shocking or a surprise honestly. But, what we haven't seen is a Trump opponent who was capable of actually relating to real, everyday people. Her facial expressions, body language, and general exasperated nature gave us something to grab onto, something recognizable. Validation that all the gaslighting the GOP does about Trump is just that, gaslighting, and that we should trust our hearts and brains when we question the things that come out of his mouth and the promises he makes.

She expertly brought the American people's vibe to the debate stage. Few modern politicians can do that, and I think her skill in this area is being vastly underestimated so far.

Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz are proven champions for Union workers.

Kamala Harris has been an ally ally to to Labor Unions. She has helped to advance several policies to
establish protections around minimum wage, fair wage increases, improved working conditions,
and a worker's right to join a Union and collectively bargain.

As a former teacher and Union member, Tim Walz has been standing up for Minnesota Union
workers for decades. As Governor, Walz secured unemployment compensation for hourly school
workers and bus drivers, banned captive audience meetings, and achieved paid leave. ""Walz shows
his compassion for his community by walking the walk,"" said Joint Council 32 President Tom
Erickson. ""He has stood beside us on our picket lines, listened to our concerns, and increased protections for Union workers in warehouse, refinery, construction, and automotive technician jobs.""

Joint Council 32 Teamsters support candidates who back Unions and fight for the working class.

Fox News knows that Trump is an unpopular loser and now with the Dominion lawsuit they have to tell their readers and viewers the truth sometimes.

Trump lost the debate and lost badly and everyday Kamala is raising millions of dollars and gaining more supporters. Taylor Swift endorsed Harris after the debate. She can help boost voter turnout in a key demographic for Harris. Trump would not answer questions about a national abortion ban. He would 100% ban abortion nationwide if elected. He would not answer questions about improving health care, because he has no plan to do that and never will.

He would not answer questions about his tariffs and refuses to say that tariffs are a tax that is paid for by American consumers. American consumers would pay higher prices for things from other countries, the shirts from Temu would cost 100% more or computers and TVs would double in price because Trump would tax them before they could be sold to US customers.

Do not believe Trump's lies about immigrants eating dogs. Haitian immigrants do not eat cats or dogs. They eat chicken and pork just like Don Old Trump. Haitian food is fantastic and Trump and Jeffery Dahmer Vance are racist assholes.

**Fuck Jeffery Dahmer Vance and the Racist Orange Palpatine, America is done with your bullshit and we aren't going back ever. We are never ever getting back together to quote Taylor Swift.**","millenials",86,"https://www.reddit.com/r/millenials/comments/1fe4n9f/fox_news_knows_trump_lost_the_debate/"

"2024-08-27",1724771802,"JPMorgan Chase is advocating for less government regulation and more private sector influence in governance over Wall Street Casino banks. Counter argument: Pull their FDIC backing and see how quickly the bank collapses. =% ","By Pam Martens and Russ Martens: August 27, 2024 ~
The P.R. genius at JPMorgan Chase that thought it would be a good idea to have Jamie Dimon lecture the next president of the United States on how to run the country in an OpEd (paywall) at the Washington Post will likely be seeking a career change soon.
Dimon is the Chairman and CEO of the largest and riskiest bank in the United States. Under Dimons tenure, the bank has racked up five felony counts which showcase Dimon as the worst possible source of sound leadership advice. In 2014, the bank was charged with laundering money for decades for the biggest Ponzi artist in U.S. history  Bernie Madoff. In 2015, the bank was charged with being part of a bank cartel that rigged foreign currency markets. And in 2020, the bank was charged with two more felony counts for engaging in tens of thousands of instances of unlawful trading in gold, silver, platinum, and palladium&as well as thousands of instances of unlawful trading in U.S. Treasury futures contracts and in U.S. Treasury notes and bonds&
Not to put too fine a point on it, but U.S. Treasury notes and bonds are how our government pays its debts. Apparently, nothing is sacred at Dimons bank.
The bank admitted to all five felony counts and paid large fines in order to get off easy with deferred prosecution agreements from the U.S. Department of Justice.
Last year, Dimons bank spent the better part of the year fending off two lawsuits that charged it in federal court in Manhattan with facilitating Jeffrey Epsteins sex trafficking of underage girls for more than a decade. One lawsuit was filed by the Attorney General of the U.S. Virgin Islands where Epstein maintained a private island compound; the other lawsuit was initiated by Epsteins victims.
The U.S. Virgin Islands Attorney General wrote in one filing:
Even if participation requires active engagement&there is no genuine dispute that JPMorgan actively participated in Epsteins sex-trafficking venture from 2006 until 2019. The Court found allegations that the Bank allowed Epstein to use its accounts to send dozens of payments to then-known co-conspirators [redacted] provided excessive and unusual amounts of cash to Epstein; and structured cash withdrawals so that those withdrawals would not appear suspicious went well beyond merely providing their usual [banking] services to Jeffrey Epstein and his affiliated entities and were sufficient to allege active engagement.
As is typical, JPMorgan Chase paid $290 million to settle the case brought by victims and $75 million to settle the U.S. Virgins Islands case.
Why the bank has not been criminally charged by the U.S. Department of Justice with laundering money for a sex trafficker of children is something that the Washington Posts Editorial Board might want to address in an editorial rather than providing an opinion platform for a serial crime boss. (See a broader look at JPMorgan Chases rap sheet here.)
Rick Newman, a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance, had some choice words for Dimons views in the OpEd. (Click on the video at the top of the related article here.) Newman says this in the video:
I think the Washington Post got the headline wrong on this story. I think the headline should be Bromides from a Billionaire. I think this is Jamie Dimons weakest take in memory. Its like the JPMorgan P.R. department got their weakest writer and said, hey, string together some platitudes  Jamie Dimon needs another byline.
Below the video is an article describing how JPMorgan Chase, with Dimon at the helm, has decided its no longer going to sit back willingly and be regulated by federal banking regulators. If it doesnt like the regulations, its going to sue its federal regulators in court. (Seriously  you cant make this stuff up.) See our January report: Jamie Dimon Hires Dodd-Frank Hatchet Man to Weigh Suing the Fed Over Proposed Capital Rules.
Below the article, as of this morning, are 921 comments  a significant portion of which are skewering the Wall Street megabanks.
A commenter using the name Dave writes this:
The banking and securities industries need more oversight not less. They dont want to adhere to laws and regulations? Pull their FDIC backing and see how quickly the bank collapses.
PK writes:
When banks testify on their behalf, they have zero concern for the consumer. Their concern is how regulation will adversely impact the stock price, which is their sole measurement for performance and income. They sit there together  basically a collaborative monopoly  to protect their incomes.
Cat on the Wall offers this:
Because they know the Supreme Court is in their pocket. But make no mistake, Jamie Dimon will be the first in line with his hands out to the government if his TBTF bank crashes in the next recession.
For how Jamie Dimons bailouts work in the real world, see: Nomura, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs Received a Cumulative $8 Trillion from the Feds Emergency Repo Loans in Fourth Quarter of 2019; and this: Despite Its Five Felony Counts, the Federal Reserve Has Entrusted $2 Trillion in Bonds to JPMorgan Chase.
One of the craziest things that Dimon writes in that Washington Post OpEd is this:
The private sector has huge wells of expertise and produces 85 percent of our nations jobs. It should have a seat at the table.
Is it possible that Dimon has been so consumed with defending his bank against criminal charges that he doesnt realize that every Executive Branch cabinet post that has anything to do with money has gone largely to a particular private sector representative  Wall Street.
For just how preposterous Dimons assertion is that the private sector is not getting a seat at the table in government, see our 2020 article: Goldman Sachs: The Vampire Squids Alum Control Two Fed Banks, the U.S. Treasury, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England.
The head of the Federal Reserve is Jerome Powell. He got rich at the Carlyle Group, a vulture fund with a shady history.
Donald, as President, came directly from the real estate private sector and proceeded to pack his federal agencies with private sector guys from the very industry that the agency regulated. American Prospect has put up an interactive graph of the unprecedented corruption that followed.
For just how much control Wall Street has had of the U.S. Treasury, there is the famous video in Michael Moores movie, Capitalism: A Love Story, where Treasury Secretary Donald Regan whispers in President Ronald Reagans ear while he is delivering a speech and barks at him to speed it up  like President Reagan is merely an actor on the payroll of the real money men in charge. Notice that President Reagan doesnt seem surprised or annoyed but acts as if he is accustomed to taking orders from this man.
Donald Regan had been the Chairman and CEO of Merrill Lynch, the largest Wall Street brokerage firm in terms of stockbroker headcount throughout much of the last century.
Industrialist and banking titan, Andrew Mellon, had such a grip on the cabinet post of U.S. Treasury Secretary that he sat in the chair from 1921 to 1932, under three Republican Presidents  Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. Mellon was at the helm during the Wall Street boom years of the 1920s and the devastating bust that came in 1929 to 1932, ushering in the Great Depression.
Andrew Mellons grandson, Timothy Mellon, heir to the familys banking fortune, has pumped $125 million in this election cycle into the Super PAC supporting Donald, Make America Great Again, Inc.

His father then helps him avoid the draft for Vietnam and Trump is suddenly diagnosed with bone spurs. Trump's father dies, and trump receives nearly half a billion dollars. Runs for president and despite being below average in intelligence and having the vocabulary of a 10 year old, he wins regardless of the odds.

A new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows that Trump leads Vice President Harris 47% to 43% among likely Iowa voters  a far slimmer margin than the 18-point lead the former Republican president enjoyed over Democratic President Biden in late spring. 

Before Biden ended his reelection campaign, a June Iowa Poll showed Trump leading 50% to 32%.  

This is the Iowa Polls first test of Harris strength against Trump since she became the Democratic Partys presidential nominee in August. 

The poll puts the race more closely in line with the 2020 election results, which ultimately saw Trump win Iowa by about 8 percentage points over Biden.  

Now, 81% of all Iowans say they will definitely vote in the general election, up from 76% in June.

It marks the furthest Harris has gone to date in her pledge to restore abortion rights if she is elected in November.

She has repeatedly said she would sign legislation passed by Congress to restore Roe v. Wade, which was overturned by the Supreme Courts conservative majority in 2022.

Harris has made reproductive rights central to her campaign, blaming former President Trump for the end of Roe v. Wade and the restrictive abortion bans subsequently passed by states across the country. Her campaign has highlighted the stories of women whose health was jeopardized and who had to travel across state lines to receive care because of state-level abortion restrictions.

Harris previously said during her 2020 presidential primary campaign that she would back ending the filibuster to pass sweeping climate change legislation.

&gt; 
&gt; **Statement from Vice President Harris on Report of Georgia Death Under Abortion Ban**
&gt; 
&gt; *[ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/georgia-abortion-ban-amber-thurman-death): The First Time an Abortion-Related Death, Officially Deemed Preventable, Is Coming to Public Light*
&gt; 
&gt; On Monday, ProPublica published a [new report](https://www.propublica.org/article/georgia-abortion-ban-amber-thurman-death) on the first time an abortion-related death, officially deemed preventable, is coming to public light. The report reveals the story of a 28 year-old woman from Georgia who ultimately died when she did not receive urgent care needed for an infection under Georgias extreme abortion ban.
&gt; 
&gt; ***In response to this reporting, Vice President Kamala Harris released the following statement:***
&gt; 
&gt; This young mother should be alive, raising her son, and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school.
&gt; 
&gt; This is exactly what we feared when Roe was struck down. In more than 20 states, Trump Abortion Bans are preventing doctors from providing basic medical care. Women are bleeding out in parking lots, turned away from emergency rooms, losing their ability to ever have children again. Survivors of rape and incest are being told they cannot make decisions about what happens next to their bodies. And now women are dying. These are the consequences of Donald Trumps actions.
&gt; 
&gt; There is so much at stake in this election, including restoring the freedoms that have been taken away from us. If Donald Trump gets the chance, he will sign a national abortion ban, and these horrific realities will multiply. We must pass a law to restore reproductive freedom. When I am President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Lives depend on it.

&gt; 
&gt; **JD Vance Greeted With Chorus of Boos at Firefighters Union Conference**
&gt; 
&gt; Both VP nominees addressed the IAFF. Walz was on fire. Vance flamed out.
&gt; 
&gt; Following Governor Walzs [rousing reception](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/08/28/metro/walz-harris-vice-presidential-candidate-addresses-firefighters-union-boston/?event=event12) yesterday at the IAFF Convention, today JD Vance was welcomed with [sustained](https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1829195356971651174) [boos](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1829198511939702946).
&gt; 
&gt; His lies about his and Trumps anti-worker record were fact checked in real time by the audience, who werent shy in letting Vance know how they really felt:
&gt; 
&gt; **Vance:** President Trump and I are proud to be the most pro-worker Republican ticket in history.
&gt; 
&gt; **Crowd:** BOOOOOOOOOOO!
&gt; 
&gt; Its no surprise. Donald Trump and JD Vances [Project 2025](https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf) agenda puts forward the most aggressive anti-labor plans in recent history.
&gt; 
&gt; * [Banning](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/04/project-2025-trump-unions-overtime-pay) public-sector unions
&gt; 
&gt; * [Allowing](https://twitter.com/thereidout/status/1821728280308834309) states to opt out of minimum wage laws and making it easier for companies to avoid paying overtime
&gt; 
&gt; * [Attacking](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/04/project-2025-trump-unions-overtime-pay) union workers and workers right to organize
&gt; 
&gt; * [Stripping](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/04/project-2025-trump-unions-overtime-pay) child labor laws and weakening worker protections to boost corporate profits
&gt; 
&gt; *The following is a statement from* ***Harris-Walz 2024 Spokesperson Sarafina Chitika*** *on JDs tough crowd:*
&gt; 
&gt; JD tried selling firefighters on the Trump-Vance Project 2025 agenda to undermine workers, gut labor protections, and cut overtime pay  and got hosed. This election, workers are fired up to elect Vice President Harris and Governor Walz. They wont be fooled by Donald Trump or JD Vances lies about their plan to undermine unions and Americas middle class.

&gt; 
&gt; Last night in an interview with Fox News Mark Levin, Donald Trump [admitted](https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1830401090183102510) to interfering with the 2020 presidential election and [claimed](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/02/trump-election-results-2020-interfere-interview) he had every right to do it.

""Hell of a job"", George Bush, Jr, said. The people of New Orleans differed in that opinion.

Michael Brown, a man who had absolutely no experience in government management was appointed by Bush to be the director of FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) and responsible for his agency's response to the devastation of hurricane *Katrina*.  Because he had no experience or even no ability, he completely botched his agency's response to the catastrophe. Citizens who didn't die in the streets were stranded for days in in wrecked homes and on rooftops with no access to food or water.

Finally, after ten days he resigned and the agency was put under the control of an experienced and competent administrator, and relief began to arrive within hours.

The nation watched in open-mouthed horror as the tragedy played out while this incompetent administrator bungled everything he touched. Now Trump and the Republicans want to appoint those of Brown's ilk to every bureau and agency in the government.

The Conservative Manifesto, Project 2025, includes a plan to replace competent and experienced administrators in every phase of government with political sycophants, amateurs, and yes men. The scientists of NASA could be replaced by a guy named Phil who hold no degrees beyond a GED. Lawyers in the Justice Department could be overseen by by a former barber from Peoria whose only legal experience revolves around fighting a DUI, and Homeland Security could be directed by any high school dropout who will vow fealty to the short-sighted GOP.

Okay, I'm making fun, but it is not a funny matter. Citizens with no managerial experience or aptitude could be put in positions of enormous importance to our security, and they are bound to fail in circumstances they never dreamed of, -- all in an effort to give Trump complete dictatorial power.

The Republicans did this to us once, now they will do it again in spades if elected.

See this -- boldface mine.

The 2025 Presidential Transition Project,\[3\] also known as **Project 2025,** is an initiative organized by the Heritage Foundation with the aim of promoting a collection of conservative and right-wing policy proposals to **reshape the United States federal government** and **consolidate executive power** should Donald Trump win the 2024 presidential election.\[4\]\[5\] The Project asserts that the entire executive branch is under the direct control of the president under Article II of the U.S. Constitution and the unitary executive theory.\[6\]\[7\] It proposes **reclassifying tens of thousands of federal civil service** workers as political appointees, in order to **replace them with loyalists** more willing to enable Trump's policies.\[8\]\[9\] In doing so, proponents argue that the change would dismantle what they view as a vast, unaccountable, and mostly liberal government bureaucracy.\[10\] The Project seeks to **infuse the government and society with Christian values.**\[11\]\[12\] Critics have characterized **Project 2025** as an **authoritarian, Christian nationalist plan to steer the U.S. toward autocracy.\[11\]\[13\] Many legal experts have said it would undermine the rule of law,\[14\] the separation of powers,**\[5\] the **separation of church and state,\[15\] and civil libertie**s.\[5\]\[14\]\[16\]...

Experts, including De Haan, expect gas prices to continue dropping in the U.S. in the coming weeks, as U.S. refineries seem to be handling heatwaves better than they did last yearwhen soaring temperatures forced Texas refineries to reduce operationsand this year's hurricane season has so far been quieter than expected.

While presidents and their administrations have very little control over gas priceswhich can be affected by major global events, decisions on oil production made in third countries like Iran, and extreme weather eventsthey're often blamed when gas prices rise.

The vice president is already claiming lower gas prices as a victory, celebrating it as an achievement of the Biden-Harris administration. On Friday, she wrote on X: ""inflation is down to its lowest level in over three years. Gas prices are down nearly 50 cents compared to Labor Day last year.""","democrats",45,"https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/1f76a76/kamala_harris_poised_to_get_a_major_boost_from/"

Texas has [just removed over 1million voters from their register of voters](https://abc13.com/post/governor-abbott-says-1-million-texans-have-been-removed-voter-rolls-2021-effort-crackdown-illegal-voting/15233065/). This is happening late so getting incorrectly deleted voters back on the register is an urgent task. As many will have heard, the Republicans are claiming to try to stop non-citizens voting, but only 6k (less than 1%) of those removed are even claimed to be non-citizens. Most that get removed from the register will likely be American Citizens that don't read all their junk mail, perhaps have moved to a new address since they registered or in some cases died. It could easily be that hundreds of thousands of them will be legitimate US citizens wanting to vote in Texas who will no longer be able to do that. 

Registering to vote in Texas is made especially difficult compared to other states. There are [special rules for helping others to register which mean you need to be registered yourself](https://afj.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TX-Voter-Registration-Guide-2022-2.pdf), which many people are beginning to do.

In November, there is certain to be a *huge* disenfranchisement of eligible voters. Only by everybody making sure that Texans are aware of this and know how to re-register can those disenfranchised voters regain their right to vote. In the past, such purges of the voters register have very much targeted people  who have less time and connection to the internet, such as  elderly members of minority groups or the hard working poor, or young immigrants, [making it difficult for them to register](https://www.texastribune.org/2024/04/10/texas-high-school-voter-registration/).","conservativeterrorism",44,"https://www.reddit.com/r/conservativeterrorism/comments/1f2fgii/texas_removed_1_million_from_the_voters_register/"

""If his mouth is open, he's lying"" is a commonly repeated refrain.

Project 2025 will undo centuries of governmental design, replace experts in management and organization with hand picked stooges with no expertise other than in fawning over their tin God.

Remember 'Brownie,' the Bush appointee who couldn't even get water delivered to the suffering New Orleans masses after Katrina? Picture 50,000 inept clones.

Project 2025 will, among other things, institute a national ban on abortion, extremely curtail veteran rights, reduce Social Security benefits, eliminate overtime pay, eliminate Obamacare and provide no alternative, politicize the Justice Department so only hand-picked criminals will be prosecuted while corporations and crooked politicians walk free, and this is just the beginning of the travesties the dictator will implement on day one!

Here are poll results indicating just how much Americans fear project 2025 and its implementation by a Republican victory in the fall.:

Matt Canter, a pollster from Global Strategy Group, on Wednesday briefed Democratic campaign staffers, political consultants, advocacy organizations and journalists about a poll conducted from Aug. 22 to Aug. 28 in 27 states, focusing on 63 ""battleground"" congressional districts up for grabs in November's election.

Canter said Project 2025 ""has penetrated the electorate in a very difficult and noisy environment.""

And that's bad news for Trump and Republicans running down ballot from him for congressional seats. The poll touched on congressional districts in six swing states  Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin  expected to determine who wins the presidency. The poll was sponsored by the advocacy groups End Citizens United, Third Way and MoveOn as a road map for making sure Project 2025 doesn't just stick to Trump but also gets linked to Republicans seeking House seats.

Canter called that ""an exciting opportunity to play offense.""

""Nearly two-thirds of voters report hearing or seeing something about Project 2025, and the disdain runs deep,"" he said. ""And it's not just Democratic base voters driving animosity. We see a majority of the swing voters that have heard are familiar with Project 2025 are deeply unfavorable as well.""

#Georgia

**The Georgia State Board of Elections continued its streak of passing unprecedentedand potentially illegalelection rules last week, adding yet another pretext for conservatives to undermine a Harris victory in the state.**

In a 3-2 vote, the Board [mandated](https://www.augustachronicle.com/story/news/politics/elections/state/2024/09/20/georgia-elections-offices-can-hand-count-votes-on-election-night-says-board/75310521007/) that county election boards must hand count all ballots in addition to using standard voting machines. While hand counts are often used in post-election audits, requiring a full hand count prior to official reporting of the results is a time-consuming and error-prone process that risks delaying and undermining election results.

&gt;""Counting thousands of ballots by hand will be incredibly tenuous, expensive and possibly error-prone process,"" said Kristin Nabers, state director for All Voting is Local Action, a group that advocates expanding voter access. ""Any human errors can be exploited by election deniers to sow distrust and decrease confidence in our elections."" [...]

&gt;The Georgia Association of Voter Registration and Election Officials weighed in this week with a letter to board members objecting to changing the rule on hand-counting ballots, citing its potential to ""delay results, set fatigued employees up for failure, and undermine the very confidence the rule's author claims to seek.""

Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr (R) [warned](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/771219212-FILE-1759.pdf) the Board before Fridays meeting that compelling the hand count of ballots very likely exceed[s] the Boards statutory authority and appear[s] to conflict with the statutes governing the conduct of elections. A lawyer for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) also [attempted](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/us/elections/georgia-elections-board-rules.html) to dissuade the Board, cautioning that it is far too late in the election process for counties to implement new rules and procedures, and many poll workers have already completed their required training.

The three members who voted to approve the new ruleJanice Johnston, Rick Jeffares, and Janelle Kinghave been [praised](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/georgia-election-rule-trump-allies-raise-fear-chaos-113850222) by Trump as ""pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory. The same trio is behind a slew of other rules that could [wreak havoc](https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/369275/georgia-elections-board-maga-stolen-election) in November, including a requirement that local election officials conduct a reasonable inquiry into results before certifying the election and another granting them unprecedented power to access all election related documentation.

&gt;This upends the longstanding rule that superintendents merely perform the ministerial task of tabulating votes, and it would give these local superintendents broad new authority to search for supposed irregularities in an election and to refuse to certify an election if they claim to find some&

&gt;The state boards new rules&allow local elections officials to dig through documents looking for something they think could be an irregularity, and then to refuse to certify the results based on their own idiosyncratic conclusion that the election was not conducted properly. If Trump loses Georgia in November, moreover, his campaign will very likely lobby local officials to use this power aggressively in an effort akin to the pressure Trump and his allies put on local officials in 2020.

A potential Trump-led effort to overturn Georgias election results ([again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Raffensperger_phone_call)) would find a not insignificant number of friendly ears. According to the [Atlanta Journal-Constitution](https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-republicans-pursue-power-over-certifying-election-results/JXEH2QC43JCIBJ7QEPXOLSK5SY/), at least 19 election board members across nine Georgia counties&have objected to certifying an election over the past four years. Some of these board members are part of a behind-the-scenes network of election deniers coordinating on policy and messaging to both call the results of Novembers election into question before a single vote is cast, as detailed by [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/18/trump-election-georgia):

&gt;The group  which includes elections officials from at least five counties  calls itself the Georgia Election Integrity Coalition&They include Michael Heekin, a Republican member of the Fulton county board of elections who refused to certify results this year; his colleague Julie Adams, who has twice refused to certify results this year and works for the prominent national election denier groups Tea Party Patriots and the Election Integrity Network; and Debbie Fisher of Cobb county, Nancy Jester of DeKalb county and Roy McClain of Spalding county  all of whom refused to certify results last November&

&gt;The group has heard from speakers at their meetings that include the state election board member Dr. Janice Johnston, an election denier who smiled and waved to the crowd at Trumps 3 August rally in Atlanta in which he praised her and two other Republicans on the board as pit bulls fighting for victory.

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) joined with a coalition of local election board members to [sue](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25071982/georgia-election-certification-seb-rules-petition.pdf) the Georgia State Election Board (SEB), seeking to block the earlier rules passed by the MAGA majority. Certifying election results is mandatory, the plaintiffs argue, and contesting the results is meant to be handled by the courts, not certifying officials. 

&gt;Through rulemaking, SEB has attempted to turn the straightforward and mandatory act of certificationi.e. confirmation of the accurate tabulation of the votes castinto a broad license for individual board members to hunt for purported election irregularities of any kind, potentially delaying certification and displacing longstanding (and court-supervised) processes for addressing fraud. Under two rules each passed by a 3-2 vote, election officials must now (1) conduct a reasonable inquiry prior to certification and (2) permit individual county board
members to examine all election related documentation created during the conduct of elections. According to their drafters, these rules rest on the assumption that certification of election results by a county board is discretionary and subject to free-ranging inquiry that may delay certification or foreclose it entirely. But that is not the law in Georgia. Rather, election officials have a non-discretionary duty to certify results by 5 p.m. six days after election day. Allegations of fraud or election misconduct are then resolved by the courts in properly filed challenges, not by county boards in the counting process. 

A bench trial is scheduled for October 1 in Fulton County Superior Court.

#Nebraska

**Congressional Republicans are ramping up the pressure on Nebraska lawmakers to change their states method of allocating electoral votes to benefit Donald Trump.**

Instead of the winner-take-all system that 48 states use, Nebraska divides three of its electoral votes between congressional districts and awards the final two to the statewide winner. Its two rural districts are solidly Republican; only the 2nd district, containing Omaha and its suburbs, has a chance of trending Democratic. For example, Biden won the district by over 6 points in 2020, capturing one of the states five electoral votes.

Now, with the presidential race tightening, national Republicans are hoping the state will issue a last-minute change to ensure Omahas electoral vote wont go to Kamala Harris. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham (R), acting on behalf of the Trump campaign, [visited](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/lindsey-graham-visits-nebraska-push-electoral-vote-change-rcna171760) Nebraska last week to meet with Gov. Jim Pillen (R) and encourage [him] to call a special legislative session at which lawmakers could consider changing the state's apportionment of electoral votes:

&gt;Pillen, a Republican, was ""receptive"" to Graham's overtures Wednesday and indicated that he would call a special session if he thought he had the votes, the source said&""As I have consistently made clear, I strongly support statewide unity and joining 48 other states by awarding all five of our electoral college votes to the presidential candidate who wins the majority of Nebraskans votes,"" Pillen said in a statement last week. ""As I have also made clear, I am willing to convene the Legislature for a special session to fix this 30-year-old problem before the 2024 election.""

Two-thirds of Nebraskas unicameral legislature, or 33 senators, are required to vote to change the states electoral vote apportionment method. It appears, based on [news reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/us/politics/nebraska-trump-electoral-vote.html), that just one lawmaker is standing in the way: Sen. Mike McDonnell of Omaha, a former Democrat who switched to the GOP earlier this year after being [censured](https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/03/02/nebraska-dems-censure-state-sen-mike-mcdonnell/) for his anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ+ votes. Despite the mounting local and national pressure, McDonnell [says](https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/09/23/state-sen-mike-mcdonnell-deflates-gop-hopes-for-nebraska-winner-take-all-in-2024/) he will not vote for a winner-takes-all system this year:

&gt;Elections should be an opportunity for all voters to be heard, no matter who they are, where they live, or what party they support, McDonnell said in a statement. I have taken time to listen carefully to Nebraskans and national leaders on both sides of the issue. After deep consideration, it is clear to me that right now, 43 days from Election Day, is not the moment to make this change.

&gt;McDonnell said he told Pillen his stance and suggested that the Legislature put winner-take-all to a vote of the people, as a proposed constitutional amendment, so people can decide the issue once and for all.

Should McDonnell change his mind, and if Nebraska changes its apportionment method, the odds will increase that Trump and Harris both receive 269 electoral votes. In that scenario, the race would be thrown to the U.S. House, where each state delegation would get one vote for president.

#Third party candidates

**The Republican party is continuing its attempts to remove third party candidates from the ballot where they believe votes will be siphoned from Trump, while boosting third party candidates in states where another option on the ballot will hurt Harris.**

On August 23, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his independent presidential campaign and endorsed Trump. In the following days and weeks, Kennedy began filing lawsuits to get his name off the ballot despite missing the deadline in multiple instances. 

First, in North Carolina, the state Supreme Court [ruled](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-must-removed-north-carolina-ballots-state-supreme-court-rules-rcna170341) 4-3 in Kennedys favor, ordering election administrators to destroy nearly 3 million already-printed ballots and restart the design and printing process. Kennedy did not file his request for removal until August 27, five days after the states deadline, and should have been forced to stay on the ballot under state law. The Courts conservative majority disagreed, writing that keeping Kennedy on the ballot would infringe on voters fundamental right to vote their conscience and have that vote count. Consequently, absentee ballots for tens of thousands of voters were [delayed](https://www.wxii12.com/article/were-ready-offices-across-the-state-preparing-to-mail-out-absentee-ballots/62336291) by two weeks, with the first being mailed tomorrow.

Meanwhile, in Michigan, both the states Supreme Court and a federal judge reached the opposite conclusion, determining that it is too late to remove Kennedys name from the ballot. Reprinting ballots at this late hour would undoubtedly halt the voting process in Michigan and cause a burden to election officials, U.S. District Judge Denise Hood [ruled](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-mied-2_24-cv-12375/pdf/USCOURTS-mied-2_24-cv-12375-1.pdf) last week. Kennedy [appealed](https://x.com/CraigDMauger/status/1838320652174135660) to the Sixth Circuit yesterday, arguing that it is irrelevant that more than 90% of the ballots have already been printed.

Kennedys third attempt to have his name removed from the ballot is taking place in Wisconsin, where the states Supreme Court [announced](https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-supreme-court-kennedy-ballot-26d1d512179d48f3dd969a76c73fe51f) on Friday that it will decide the issue as expeditiously as possible. Election clerks in Wisconsin have already begun sending absentee ballots with Kennedys name.

What do all of the above states have in common? Theyre swing states where Kennedys name could draw potential Trump voters away from voting for the former president. In blue states, like New York, Kennedy is seeking the opposite result: he is suing to *stay on* the ballot. In a filing to the U.S. Supreme Court yesterday, Kennedy [asked](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25172055/24a285.pdf) for an emergency order to restore his name to the ballot, arguing that voters who signed petitions supporting him have a constitutional right to have Kennedy placed on the ballot  and to vote for him, whether he is campaigning for their vote or not.

The cynical effort to pick and choose on which state ballots Kennedy appears follows the [GOP campaign](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republican-allies-jill-stein-green-party-democrats-ballots-battleground-states/) to get Green Party candidate Jill Stein on Nevadas ballot in the hopes of siphoning votes from Harris. Trump attorney Jay Sekulow represented the Green Party pro bono during its litigation before the U.S. Supreme Court, ultimately losing the fight to appear on the Nevada ballot. Similarly, Trump lawyer Michael D. Dean represented the Green Party in Wisconsin, where the state Supreme Court ruled to keep Stein on the ballot.","Keep_Track",41,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1fo9iuy/how_to_rig_an_election_maga_playbook_underway_in/"

The coalition launched earlier this year in support of increasing regulations on regulated monopolies like Michigans energy companies as well as companies seeking government contracts when it comes to their political contributions. 

State Rep. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City) has already introduced two pieces of legislation seeking to block electrical or natural gas utilities or their political nonprofits or political action committees (PACs) arms from donating or contributing to political entities tied to current or former elected officials and candidates for office, or state or local party committees. 

According to Daniel Hopkins, communications director for Michigan United, one of the organizations making up the coalition, Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) is expected to introduce similar bills in the Senate while Sen. Rosemary Bayer (D-Beverly Hills) and Rep. Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit) are expected to introduce additional legislation banning political contributions from companies seeking government contracts. Hopkins said they expect to see final drafts from the Michigan Legislative Service Bureau any day now.

DTE Energy and Consumers Energy  Michigans largest energy companies  have been subject to increased scrutiny in recent years, with a report by the Illinois-based Citizens Utility Board ranking Michigan among the worst in the nation for overall utility performance.

People across Michigan are fed up. Theyre sick and tired of poor energy reliability, for rising costs. Michiganders pay the highest energy rates in the region, but deal with the worst service, Wegela previously said during press conference discussing his legislation.

It is much cheaper for these corporations to spend money buying influence in the political process than it is for them to improve the quality of their services, Wegela said.

While 102 of 148 sitting Michigan lawmakers have received campaign contributions from utility company political action committees (PACs) totaling more than $2 million, according to a [report from Bridge Michigan](https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/utilities-gave-big-michigan-lawmakers-now-weighing-reforms-records-show), spokespeople for both DTE and Consumers Energy have maintained the companys contributions are above board.

According to the survey, more than 81% of voters supported the proposals to bar regulated monopolies and corporations seeking government contractors from making political contributions, with 59% of voters surveyed expressing strong support and 22% saying they somewhat support the legislation. Overall, 9% of voters surveyed expressed opposition to the bills. 

The survey includes 700 voters from across the state, including oversamples of battleground districts for state representatives and African-American voters weighted to match statewide populations. 

While the economy and inflation ranked as the top issue for voters  with 74% of voter surveyed saying it was very important in determining their vote for state representative in November  the influence of money in politics remained a prime concern among 85% of voters, with 61% rating it as very important in determining their vote and 24% labeling it somewhat important. 

Additionally, the coalitions proposals found support from 81% of voters in battleground districts, as well as 90% support among Democrats, 84% support among independents and 66% support from Republicans. 

Support for the proposal also grew after voters were exposed to messaging both in favor of and opposing the legislation with support in battleground districts growing to 90% and support among Republicans growing to 82%. 

Voters were particularly drawn to statements focused on accountability, corruption, and health care or prescription drugs. However the majority of voters surveyed were swayed by comments on energy costs, reliability, and actions to ban political spending by monopoly corporations and government contractors taken by states like Connecticut and Georgia. 

Arguments against the proposal failed to resonate with voters, with the most convincing statements  Energy and utility companies have an obligation to their customers and employees to support candidates for public office that help them provide safe, reliable, affordable, and clean energy for the residents and businesses they serve every day, and This bill may be well-intentioned, but it is useless. If we try to prohibit corporate political giving, they will just find another way to move money and influence politics in their favor  effectively swaying 18% of voters. 

The most effective message in support of the proposal  Politicians are supposed to answer to the people who elect them, but when they rely on corporate contributors they end up answering to them instead. We need to pass this reform to take back our power and make our elected leaders accountable to us again,  was labeled very convincing by 71% of voters. 

When examining the impact of a candidates support for Taking Back Our Powers proposal the survey found that Democrats held a slight edge in the race for state legislature, but Republicans performed slightly better in battleground districts with Republicans leading among voters 48% versus Democrats 47%. 

A strong majority of voters said they would be more likely to support a candidate who publicly supports this proposal, despite pressure from big corporations with 47% saying they would be much more likely to support that candidate compared to 24% who said theyd be somewhat more likely to support them.

Additionally, a majority of Democrats, Republicans and undecided voters said theyd be more likely to support a candidate who backs the Taking Back Our Power bills, with 81% of people voting Democratic in legislative races, 62% of people voting Republican and 62% of undecided voters saying they would be much more, or somewhat more likely to support that candidate. 

A candidates support for the proposals also had a positive impact on voter motivation, with 60% of voters saying theyd be somewhat, or much more motivated to vote to support a candidate who opposed corporate spending in politics. 

This was particularly notable among those who vote less frequently with 63% of individuals who had voted two or fewer of the last four elections showing increased motivation, alongside 67% of voters who participated in the last three of four elections and 58% who had voted in all four previous elections.

Two members of the state Senate  Bayer and Sen. Erika Geiss (D-Taylor)  have signed on to Taking Back Our Powers pledge in support of banning monopoly corporations and government contract seekers from making political contributions.

Alongside Wegela and McKinney, 15 members of the state House have also signed on to the pledge including: Reps. Abraham Aiyash (D- Hamtramck) Kimberly Edwards (D-Eastpointe), Mai Xiong (D-Warren), Erin Byrnes (D-Dearborn), Noah Arbit (D-West Bloomfield), Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor), Jaime Churches (D-Wyandotte) James Desana (R-Carleton), Jimmie Wilson Jr. (D-Ypsilanti), Felicia Brabec (D-Pittsfield Twp.), Carrie Rheingans (D-Ann Arbor), Emily Dievendorf (D-Lansing), Rachel Hood (D-Grand Rapids), Betsy Coffia (D-Traverse City) and Jenn Hill (D-Marquette). 

All of these representatives, save for Aiyash, Hood and Brabec, are up for reelection in November.

Released on Sept. 5, the EWTN News/RealClear poll takes a deep dive into Catholic religious and political practices across the U.S. The poll, conducted from Aug. 28-30, surveyed 1,000 Catholics and has a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.

The study found that 59.4% of Hispanic Catholics plan to vote for Harris in November versus 30.4% who intend to vote for Trump.

Nine percent of Hispanic Catholics said they were still undecided and 1.2% said they would vote for another candidate besides Harris or Trump.

The EWTN News poll suggests that Catholic Hispanic support for Harris is slightly above the support President Joe Biden received in 2020, with 54.9% of respondents saying they voted for Biden in the last presidential election.

Meanwhile, undecided Hispanic voters were nearly evenly split with 48.9% leaning toward Harris and 51.1% leaning toward Trump.

Just over three-fourths  77.2%  of Hispanics said it is very likely they will cast a vote in the presidential election.","KamalaHarris",39,"https://www.reddit.com/r/KamalaHarris/comments/1f9wl0c/harris_heavily_favored_over_trump_among_hispanic/"

The jury that found him liable for sexual assault and defaming his victim was rigged. The jury that found him guilty on 34 felony counts was rigged. Presiding judges, prosecuting attorneys, corroborating witnesses, damning evidence, unanimous verdicts. All rigged.

Its ridiculous, but its Trumps go-to propaganda whenever he strikes out legally, bombs a debate, or comes up short in in a presidential election. Hes already laid the groundwork of a rigged election (that isnt) in case he loses in 2024 and must recycle old conspiracies about objectively free, fair, historically secure, and remarkably accurate elections administered nationwide with infinitesimal fraud or irregularities. 

But if you want to find real rigging of election administration, where craven partisans in high places play dirty to skew voting results on statewide ballot initiatives, by all means, come to Ohio. To borrow from the states integrity-is-overrated elections chief Frank LaRose, Ohio is the gold standard in orchestrated party subterfuge to dupe voters and throw elections.

The latest collaborative scheme by the Republican secretary of state, the Republican majority on the Ohio Ballot Board and the Republican majority on the Ohio Supreme Court to turn a November ballot referendum on its head tops the GOPs trickery last year to (unsuccessfully) tank an abortion rights initiative. This year Republican leaders dropped all pretense of good faith in fashioning and approving the ballot language for the proposed anti-gerrymandering amendment they adamantly oppose. 

Issue 1 would kick politicians out of the redistricting process altogether and put a citizen-led panel in charge of the decennial obligation. The Citizens Not Politicians referendum gained traction after the Republican-controlled redistricting commission defied voter-approved amendments to end gerrymandering and ignored court orders to follow the state constitution and make legislative and congressional district maps fairer, more competitive, and more aligned overall with statewide voting.  

The redistricting majority drew maps that unconstitutionally favored Republicans over Democrats and produced even bigger gerrymandered supermajorities in the Statehouse with locked in congressional dominance. LaRose, a reliable party line commission vote on the gerrymandered maps, drafted the wording on the anti-gerrymandering proposal, approved by the Republican ballot board majority, and largely upheld by the GOP majority on the state supreme court. 

Its rank dishonesty and prejudicial slant surpassed even the distorted ballot language LaRose drafted in 2023 (with anti-abortion lobbyists) to rig the election on the abortion rights amendment. He turned the redistricting proposal, once entitled, An amendment to replace the current politician-run redistricting process with a citizen-led commission required to create fair state legislative and congressional districts through a more open and independent system into a cautionary heading that reads To create an appointed redistricting commission not elected by or subject to removal by the voters of the state.

The ballot summary is worse. Dissenting Democratic Justice Jennifer Brunner called it perhaps the most stunningly stilted ballot language that Ohio voters will have ever seen. It manufactures alternative facts about citizen-powered redistricting to falsely suggest the anti-gerrymandering proposal is what it is not  a new taxpayer-funded commission of appointees required to gerrymander the boundaries of state legislative and congressional districts. 

That perversion of reality was a bridge too far for Justice Michael Donnelly. The Democrat, who is seeking reelection, blasted the court for giving it a pass and referenced another outrageous majority opinion (authored by Republican Justice Joe Deters, running against Democratic colleague Justice Melody Stewart for a six-year term) that bestowed new meaning to boneless chicken wings. Given that four members of this court in the majority today apparently think that the word boneless means you should expect bones, Im sure it comes as no great surprise that they think that a constitutional amendment to ban partisan gerrymandering means to require gerrymander(ing).  

The complicity of the court in allowing LaRoses misleading ballot language on redistricting reform to be presented to voters as an honest explanation of what Issue 1 will do is beyond the pale of acceptable. But so is LaRoses rage tweet on the same day he signed off on the deceptive ballot wording voters will read.

Its not an anti-gerrymandering measure if it literally REQUIRES gerrymandering, but this is what were up against, folks. No matter how much you try to give voters the truth, the left will always have its media machine helping to distort it. LaRose tried gaslighting with another tweet that Issue 1 is nothing more than a Democrat power grab that will require gerrymandering so liberal billionaires can take over Congress and Ohios legislature. 

He thanked Trump for speaking out against this dangerous amendment and attached the disgraced ex-presidents signature (and customized!) propaganda that Ohio Democrats and left-wing special interest groups are trying to rig Elections through the Issue 1 redistricting scam.

It would be funny if not for the travesty it is; egregious abuse of power by the Republican cabal running state government manifested in weighted, deceitful wording on the ballot summary of another statewide citizens initiative to fool voters and keep the partys grip on its gerrymandered leverage.

"2024-09-15",1726442512,"Kamala Harris (and Taylor Swift, unintentionally) have been great at emphasizing just how insecure Donald Trump is","While we're all aware of how insecure Trump is despite his assertions otherwise, both Kamala Harris and Taylor Swift have done a great job showing the masses how **insecure** he can be. I want to focus on the rally thing: during the debate, Kamala made sure to take a moment to mention his rallies, knowing that hed take the bait and demonstrate how easily manipulated he is by a simple jab on one of his insecurities. Many people have drawn attention to it, but I want to really emphasize **how clever she was** going about it: **rather than discourage people from going to his rallies as expected, she instead ENCOURAGES people to go**.

* If she had discouraged people (primarily Trumpists) from going, they would have gone anyway and could sell it as defying what Kacklin Kamala told them to do. Instead, she encourages other people (primarily non-Trumpists) to do something they otherwise wouldnt  go to Trump's rallies  which **paints the narrative that she has a degree of control** **over who shows up**  and that's something he cant stand.
* If theres ever an uptick of people going to Trumps rallies, in the back of everyones mind (including Trumps) there may be a tendency to attribute it not to Trumps own success, but rather Kamala egging people on to go  meaning that **Trump may have to worry about a portion of attendees not being real supporters** of his and increasing his insecurity, even if that's not the case.

Now maybe I'm totally off. I can't know what Kamala was thinking when she made that remark, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if she planned this jab in a way that would hit the hardest.

Of course, then theres Taylor Swift. [Last week she made a very well-reported  and very balanced  statement on her choice to vote for Kamala](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-rcna170547). I don't like Taylor or her music; I don't dislike her either, but either way she is very smart and handled the situation excellently. She **didnt tell her followers to vote for anyone, but encouraged them to do research** and vote for whomever has the better policies to them. She gave her own personal reasons for voting for Kamala and Walz, but also framed her public announcement as a way to clear up disinformation regarding the A.I. fake Taylor Trump endorsement. Trump reacted to this initially by trying to downplay it like his followers have, [but recently has grown increasingly agitated](https://www.gbnews.com/politics/us/donald-trump-i-hate-taylor-swift-us-politics-election-latest) at just how influential a **SINGLE** one of her posts has been. **Trump supporters basically have two responses to Taylor, both of which Trump has been ruining by being insecure**:

* Some of his supporters try to criticize Taylor by saying that as an entertainer, her opinions should mean nothing. Ignoring the fact that they praise people like Kid Rock and Hulk Hogan when THEIR candidate is the one being endorsed, **Trump HIMSELF had readily accepted a clearly-fake A.I. post of a fake Taylor Swift making a Trump endorsement**. Trump HIMSELF had been saying that an endorsement from Taylor Swift is A-OK. If he hadnt been so terminally online that he just responds to every modicum of praise on his echo chamber, perhaps she wouldnt have made that post in the first place (or maybe she would have at a later date). Either way, his ""I accept!"" of A.I. nonsense is killing this defense.
* Other Trump supporters have been attempting to downplay Taylors post, including J.D. Vance, by saying that it wont have much of an effect on people and that they generally dont care. Ignoring the fact that the post has (currently) an insane 11 million likes and almost half a million people have signed up to vote through that one post alone (and thats not counting the people who saw her post second-hand and signed up without using the link), Trump whining like a baby and making childish tantrum posts on Truth Social really **damages that narrative by showing that yes, he does care**, and yes, he is bothered.

Everyone has insecurities, but thats okay. Whats important is how you handle those insecurities  and a leader should have control over them, or else they will find themselves being controlled BY them.

###[Check your voter registration status](https://www.usa.gov/confirm-voter-registration)

Rightwing efforts to disenfranchise voters ahead of the 2024 general election are accelerating, with many attempts focusing on the removal of voters from registration databases. The movement is widespread and organized enough to gain the U.S. Department of Justices attention: Earlier this month, the DOJ issued [new guidance](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nvra_list_maintenance_guidance_final.pdf) emphasizing that it is against federal law to conduct a general list maintenance program within 90 days of a primary or general election.

&gt;Examples of list maintenance activities that may violate the [law] include comparing voter files to outdated or inaccurate records or databases, taking action that erroneously affects a particular class of voters (such as newly naturalized citizens), or matching records based solely on first name, last name, and date of birth. The prohibitions&extend to any list maintenance activity based on third-party submissions.

Conservative organizations, including the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign, are turning to the courts to try to force states to purge voters anyway.

#Georgia

In May, Gov. Brian Kemp (R) signed [Senate Bill 189](https://legiscan.com/GA/text/SB189/id/2973006) into law, encouraging baseless mass voter challenges and making it easier to invalidate a voters registration. The new law, in combination with one enacted in 2022, allows an individual to challenge the legitimacy of an unlimited number of voters based on a suspicion that the voters do not actually live in the jurisdiction. 

Since SB 189 took effect over the summer, county officials have seen an [increase](https://thecurrentga.org/2024/07/01/bolstered-by-new-georgia-law-woman-challenges-around-900-voter-registrations-in-chatham-county/) in voter challenges that appear to be part of an organized effort across the state by Republicans who falsely believe the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump. A single Republican Party activist, Helen Strahl, challenged the registrations of nearly 900 voters in Chatham County (home to Savannah), succeeding in getting 641 removed from the voter rolls. Strahl claimed the majority of the voters had moved out of the county and registered to vote elsewhere but it is unclear how she compiled the list or how accurate it is. Unhoused people, seasonal workers, and students are [among those](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/us/politics/georgia-voting-2024-election.html) caught up in purges:

&gt;A longtime compliance officer, Strahl had found her political voice during the last few years by taking advantage of a new Georgia law that allows private citizens to file mass challenges against other peoples eligibility to vote. She has legally challenged more than a thousand voters in Chatham County during the past 18 months, quietly reshaping the electorate in a crucial stretch of coastal Georgia and amplifying conspiracy theories about widespread voter fraud. She wrote to elections officials to question the eligibility of seasonal workers who moved temporarily out of state, homeless residents who didnt have a proper address and almost 700 students or former students who were registered to vote at Savannah State University, one of the countrys oldest historically Black colleges.

&gt;I live in this county, she later explained. Id like to know my vote is going to count and not be diluted. Its in my interest to help maintain a clean and accurate voting roll.

Voting rights groups filed a [lawsuit](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/12024-07-31-Complaint.pdf) seeking to block SB 189, arguing that the law violated the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA):

&gt;Under Section 8(d) of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), an election official may only remove voters from the registration list on
the basis that they have moved if one of two requirements are met. First, voters may be removed if the voter confirms in writing that they have moved. Second, voters may be removed if they receive written notice that their address needs to be confirmed and they fail to vote or otherwise confirm their address with election officials during the next two federal election cycles. 

&gt;Election officials in Chatham, Gwinnett, Forsyth, and Spalding Counties are violating Section 8(d) by removing voters who have been subjected to mass
challenges based on an alleged change of address without meeting either of these
requirements. These county boards have purged voters based on unvetted documentation and unreliable information provided by private citizens, such as screenshots of purported property records or social media posts. 

The lawsuit also challenges a second provision of SB 189 that prohibits unhoused voters from using their preferred mailing address (for example, a P.O. box or homeless shelter), forcing them to receive their election mail at the county registrars office or be removed from the voter rolls. 

&gt;SB 189 Section 4s unhoused voter mailing address restriction, which
amends O.C.G.A. § 21-2-217(a), violates Section 8(b) of the NVRA. Section 4 of
SB 189 explicitly identifies and places unnecessary, discriminatory, and unreasonable requirements solely on unhoused voters without a permanent address by restricting their mailing address for election purposes to their county registrars office. No other voters are subject to this restriction. Nor are any other voters subjected to having their election mail involuntarily directed to a location other than where they receive their other mail&By solely targeting unhoused voters without a permanent address in this way, Defendants burden their rights in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.

The Republican National Committee filed a [motion to intervene](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/642024-08-16-RNC-and-Georgia-Republican-Partys-motion-to-intervene-.pdf) last month, telling the court that the Republican Party has a clear interest in protecting their candidates, voters, and resources from plaintiffs attempt to invalidate Georgias duly enacted election rules.

#Arizona

Arizona Republican Party leaders and a conservative dark money group filed a [lawsuit](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1-2024-06-03-Complaint.pdf) to force the removal of 500,000 people from voter rolls in a state that President Joe Biden won by less than 1,000 votes. 

Arizona GOP chair Gina Swoboda, Arizona Free Enterprise Club president Scot Mussi, and failed Republican candidate Steve Gaynor allege that the state has not kept an accurate count of registered voters. According to the lawsuit, at least four counties have more registered voters than adults over the age of 18, and many others have implausibly high voter registration rates. The plaintiffs allege that they have suffered irreparable injuries as a result of inaccurate voter rolls, including the risk of vote dilution any time an ineligible voter casts a ballot and the undermining of confidence in Arizonas electoral system.

Arizona Attorney General Kristin Mayes filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs lack standing to sue because their alleged injuries do not exist:

&gt;Plaintiffs next allegation, that ineligible voters have an opportunity to vote,
which risk[s] the dilution of Plaintiffs legitimate vote is both too speculative and not a cognizable claim. Plaintiffs own Complaint admits that [t]here is no
evidence that these counties experienced above-average voter participation compared to the rest of the country or state. They acknowledge that their claimed harm does not exist. 

The state, Mayes continued, follows all relevant laws to maintain its voter registration rolls. Any perceived discrepancy identified by the plaintiffs is attributable to their own misunderstanding of statistics: the lawsuits claims are based on total registered voters instead of active registered voters. Total registered voters includes inactive voters - mainly those who may have moved but cannot legally be removed from the rolls until they fail to vote in two consecutive election cycles. Therefore, the total registered voters count may always be higher than the voting-age population because it includes people who moved away and were placed on inactive status.

* Note: People on the inactive list can still vote if it is within two election cycles of moving and/or of when the election agency had election materials returned undeliverable.

The case was assigned to District Judge Dominic Lanza, a Trump appointee, and is still pending. 

Meanwhile, Trump-aligned America First Legal Foundation (created by former advisor Stephen Miller) is pursuing a [lawsuit](https://media.aflegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/04090254/Strong-Communities-Foundation-v.-Richer-ECF-12-First-AMENDED-COMPLAINT.pdf) against Arizona alleging that the state is not thoroughly checking the citizenship of people registered to vote in federal elections. The plaintiffs provide no evidence of their claim that noncitizens are signing up to vote in Arizona. It appears the lawsuit is instead a vehicle to spread one of Donald Trumps favorite [racist conspiracy theories](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/13/g-s1-22583/trump-great-replacement-conspiracy-theory): that Democrats are bringing nonwhite immigrants into the United States to replace white voters and enact a political agenda.

* Noncitizens illegally voting is exceedingly rare. A 2016 national [study](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/noncitizen-voting-missing-millions) found that in 42 jurisdictions accounting for 23.5 million votes, there were only 30 estimated cases of suspected noncitizen voting.

#North Carolina

The RNC filed a [lawsuit](https://prod-static.gop.com/media/documents/NCGOP_v._NCSBE_-_Verified_Complaint_1724443002.pdf) against North Carolinas State Board of Elections seeking the removal of over 225,000 people from voter rollsin a state that Biden lost in 2020 by roughly 75,000 votes. 

The lawsuit stems from a mistake on voter registration forms used last year that failed to require a drivers license number or the last four digits of a Social Security number. Instead of using red text, denoting required information, the forms used black text, denoting optional information, for the identification section. The state processed approximately 225,000 applications before being made aware of the error and fixing the forms. 

The RNC and the North Carolina Republican Party are asking the court to remove everyone registered with the erroneous forms from the voter rolls. The State Board contends that the plaintiffs waited too long to bring the lawsuit, as the NVRA prohibits the removal of voters within 90 days of an election. And, even if it were legal to cancel their registration, it would be unnecessary because North Carolina has a voter ID law; in order to vote, the 225,000 people must provide the same information that the registration forms should have required. 

A second [lawsuit](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-22-Complaint-1.pdf), also filed by the RNC, alleges that the State Board of Elections has failed to use jury data to remove noncitizens from its voter rolls. According to [SB 747](https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookUp/2023/sb%20747), passed last year over Gov. Roy Coopers (D) veto, county clerks must notify the Board when a person called for jury duty informs the courts that they cannot serve because they are not U.S. citizens. The Board must then investigate and remove that person from the voting rolls if they (a) are not a citizen and (b) are registered to vote. 

The state has not yet filed an official response but [told the media](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/categorically-false-nc-elections-board-rejects-noncitizen-voting-argument-in-gop-lawsuit/ar-AA1pjNyv?ocid=BingNewsVerp) that the accusation is categorically false.

&gt;Pat Gannon, a spokesperson for the board, said this accusation was categorically false and that the agency has already worked with superior courts across the state to implement the new law. The elections board asked the NC GOP and the RNC to rescind their press releases on the lawsuit as they will undermine voter confidence on an entirely false premise.

#Michigan

There are two ongoing cases regarding voter registration in Michigan, both initiated by the national Republican party:

The Republican National Committee (RNC) and two Republican voters are [suing](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2024-04/1_Complaint%20RNC%20v%20Benson.pdf) Michigan, alleging that the state has failed to maintain accurate voter rolls. As evidence, the plaintiffs claim that at least 53 counties have more registered voters than adults over the age of 18. However, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D) [replied](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/19-2024-04-15-MI-secretary-of-state-and-direction-of-elections-brief-in-support-of-motion-to-dismiss.pdf) that the RNC is using the wrong data: to determine how many voting-age residents live in each county, the RNC relied on census data, which shows where people were living at a specific time in 2020 but not where they are legally allowed to be registered to vote. The RNC also used numbers that include inactive voters, producing an unreliable count of the number of people currently living in and registered to vote in each county. With the correct numbers, using the RNC's methodology, no county has more than 95% of residents registered to vote.

The RNC, the Trump campaign, and the Michigan Republican Party are also [suing](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1-2024-07-15-Complaint.pdf) the state over Gov. Gretchen Whitmers (D) executive order expanding the locations that can register people to vote to include agencies like Veterans Affairs offices and Small Business Administration offices. The governors order was illegal, the plaintiffs allege, because only the legislature may designate new voter registration agencies.","Keep_Track",20,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1fkhqy1/republicans_seek_voter_purges_in_swing_states/"

#Texas

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) conducted a series of raids last week targeting purported voter fraud by Latino activists. According to warrants obtained by the [Texas Tribune](https://www.texastribune.org/2024/08/24/ken-paxton-vote-harvesting-raid-lulac-cecilia-castellano/), the AGs Election Integrity Force seized cell phones and laptops belonging to several members of LULAC, the nations oldest Latino civil rights organization, including Democratic candidate Cecilia Castellano and legislative aide Manuel Medina. Paxtons office claimed in a sworn affidavit that Medina was involved in an illegal scheme to harvest votes for Castellano.

&gt;The vote harvesting services that [the woman] and Medina agreed to are for [the woman] to complete [applications for ballots by mail] for voters and then make contact with the voter when they receive the mail so that she can collect the mail ballot, the affidavit says. Based on this conversation, [the investigator] concluded that the vote harvesting services to be performed involve [the woman] being in the physical presence of an official ballot or a ballot voted by mail, intended to deliver votes for Castellano.

Vote harvesting consists of fraudulently collecting and casting other peoples ballots without their knowledge, but is often used by the GOP to refer to the entirely legal practice of organizations helping senior and disabled citizens access, fill out, and drop off their ballots. Case in point: Lidia Martinez, an 87-year-old member of LULAC who helps older Latinos register to vote. Her home was one of those [raided](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/us/texas-latinos-democrats-raids-paxton.html) by Paxtons agents:

&gt;She said she heard a knock on her door right before 6 a.m. on Tuesday&Nine officers, seven of them men, some with guns in their holsters, then pushed open the door and marched past a living room wall decorated with crucifixes, she said.

&gt;I got scared, she recalled in an interview on Sunday, speaking in both English and Spanish. They told me, We have a warrant to search your house. I said, Why? I felt harassed.

&gt;Ms. Martinez said that the officers told her they came because she had filled out a report saying that older residents were not getting mail ballots&The officers said they were looking for voter cards that residents had filled out, she said. I told them, I dont have them here, she said&

&gt;Two of the agents went to her bedroom and searched everywhere, my underwear, my nightgown, everything, they went through everything, Ms. Martinez recalled. They took her laptop, phone, planner and some documents&The officers questioned her for about three hours, she said.

LULAC CEO Juan Proaño and President Roman Palomares are [asking](https://www.scribd.com/document/763192952/LULAC-National-LULAC-President-Palomares-Ltr-Request-for-USDOJ-Investigation-TX-AG-PAXTON-26Aug24) the U.S. Justice Department to investigate Paxton for violating the Voting Rights Act in connection with the raids. ""These actions echo a troubling history of voter suppression and intimidation that has long targeted both Black and Latino communities, particularly in states like Texas, where demographic changes have increasingly shifted the political landscape, the letter says.

Meanwhile, Paxton is [suing](https://www.texastribune.org/2024/09/06/texas-ken-paxton-travis-county-voter-registration/) two Democratic counties over contracts to conduct voter registration outreach. Commissioners of Bexar County, home to San Antonio, and Travis County, home to Austin, recently voted to hire Civic Government Solutions to identify eligible, unregistered voters and offer to register them to vote with the county. 

According to Paxtons [lawsuits](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/press/Bexar%20County%20Voter%20Registration%20Program%20Complaint.pdf?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=), the counties have no authority&to print and mail unsolicited voter registration forms, and doing so would create confusion, facilitate fraud, [and] undermine confidence in elections. He is asking the courts to block Bexar and Travis counties from going forward with the plan.

* Reminder: Just a few weeks ago, Paxton [opened](https://www.texastribune.org/2024/08/26/texas-voter-registration-election-ken-paxton-investigation/) an investigation into unsubstantiated reports promoted by Fox News that migrants were registering to vote outside a drivers license office in Texas. By announcing the investigation, Paxton himself undermined confidence in elections based on apparent disinformation from known conspiracy theorist Maria Bartiromo.

#Florida

Florida organizers collected nearly a million signatures over the past year to get an abortion rights amendment on the ballot in November. Now, Gov. Ron DeSantis is [sending police](https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/elections/2024/09/06/florida-abortion-amendment-petition-signature-fraud-voters/) after voters who signed the petition.

The deadline in state law to challenge the validity of the signatures has long passed, but election administrators across Florida have been receiving requests from state officials to turn over petition signatures that their offices have already verified.

&gt;Since last week, DeSantis secretary of state has ordered elections supervisors in at least four counties to send to Tallahassee at least 36,000 petition forms already deemed to have been signed by real people. Since the Times first reported on this effort, Alachua and Broward counties have confirmed they also received requests from the state.

&gt;One 16-year supervisor said the request was unprecedented. The state did not ask for rejected petitions, which have been the basis for past fraud cases.

One of the people who signed the petition last year, Isaac Menasche, told the Tampa Bay Times that law enforcement officers showed up at his house to question him about his signature:

&gt;Menasche later posted on Facebook that it was obvious to me that a significant effort was exerted to determine if indeed I had signed the petition. He told the Times that the officer who showed up at his door had a copy of Menasches drivers license and other documents related to him. 

Another voter, Becky Castellanos, was visited by a state police officer who interrogated her about a family members petition signature. The officer said he had been questioning other voters about their signatures, as well.

&gt;Castellanos said she felt intimidated by having a law enforcement officer come to her door. And she said she was surprised but not surprised when she learned it was about Amendment 4&It didnt surprise me that they were doing something like this to try to debunk these petitions to get it taken off of the ballot, she said.

[According to DeSantis](https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2024/09/09/florida-desantis-elections-abortion-petition-police-fraud/), officers were sent to question voters after his Election Integrity Unit allegedly found some verified petitions not signed by the actual voter. The state has not provided any evidence to support the governors claim.

* The Election Integrity Unit, created in 2022 by DeSantis, was previously embroiled in controversy for [arresting](https://www.npr.org/2022/08/27/1119750187/florida-voter-fraud-charges-desantis-felon-rights) people with felonies who cast ballots after being led to believe that they were eligible to vote. Charges were later [dismissed](https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-ron-desantis-crime-florida-4038f0cf039628981f72009ecd866924) in numerous cases.

#Arizona

Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes (D) released new guidance last year designed to prohibit voter intimidation after people, sometimes masked and armed, [staked out](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/justice-department-concerned-about-armed-people-at-arizona-ballot-boxes) ballot drop boxes during the 2022 midterm elections. The provisions, outlined in the states [Election Procedures Manual](https://apps.azsos.gov/election/files/epm/2023/20231230_EPM_Final_Edits_406_PM.pdf) (EPM), include limits on repeatedly monitoring individuals near a drop box or polling place; intentionally following individuals delivering ballots to a drop box; directly confronting, questioning, photographing, or videotaping voters or poll workers in a harassing or intimidating manner; and posting signs or communicating messages in a harassing or intimidating manner near a drop box or polling place.

Arizona Free Enterprise Club (AFEC), a conservative nonprofit that has issued previous challenges to election rules, and America First Policy Institute, a Trump-aligned think tank, [sued](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-02-09-Complaint.pdf) the state to block the regulations on free speech grounds:

&gt;By regulating conduct such as observing a drop box within 75 feet of the drop box,
speaking to voters and election workers, and photographing activity at election sites, the EPM has criminalized activity which is plainly protected by the First Amendment and article 2, sections 5-6 of the Arizona Constitution.

&gt;These activitieswatching drop boxes, speaking to people at election sites, and
photographing activity at election sitesall constitute forms of speech.

&gt;For example, AFEC members are not only interested in observing activity at drop
boxes, but they are also just as interested in conveying a message to others that the drop boxes are being watched and should be watched&Even if AFECs speech might be incorrect or unpopular, it is no less protected by the First Amendment, as erroneous statements and unpopular opinions are inevitable in free debate. 
 
Judge Jennifer Ryan-Touhill of the Maricopa County Superior Court [ruled](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-08-06-ME-Ruling26.pdf) in favor of the conservative groups, blocking the state from enforcing the challenged voter intimidation provisions. While the state is allowed to ban threatening behavior in the immediate area around a polling place, Ryan-Touhill wrote, Secretary Fontess rules went too far and violated the First Amendment:

&gt;Plaintiffs speech is not protected when it violates the lawmembers of the organizations are legally prohibited from saying many things (e.g., vote for this person or else-type of threats) and doing many things (e.g., electioneering within 75 feet of a polling place). But many of the prohibitions listed in the EPM are free speech and protected by both the Arizona Constitution and the U.S. Constitution. What, for example, constitutes a person communicating about voter fraud
in a harassing manner? Or, for that matter, posting a sign in an intimidating manner? How does a person either do this behaviorwhatever it meansor avoid it? And what content printed on a t-shirt might be offensive or harassing to one and not another? What if the t-shirt says, I have a bomb and I intend to vote!? Where does the Secretary draw the line?

Fontes [plans](https://www.votebeat.org/arizona/2024/08/06/arizona-court-blocks-voter-intimidation-rules-outside-polling-places/) to appeal the order, calling the courts injunction too far-reaching.","Keep_Track",19,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1fe76ki/florida_and_texas_utilize_state_police_to/"
