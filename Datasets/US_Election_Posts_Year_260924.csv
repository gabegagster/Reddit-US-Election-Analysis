"2024-07-01",1719845050,"Megathread: US Supreme Court Finds in Trump v. United States That Presidents Have Full Immunity for Constitutional Powers, the Presumption of Immunity for Official Acts, and No Immunity for Unofficial Acts","On Monday, the US Supreme Court sent the case of Trump v. United States back to a lower court in Washington, which per [AP](https://apnews.com/live/supreme-court-trump-presidential-immunity-updates#00000190-6eb5-d1c9-a1d1-7ff720090000) has the effect of ""dimming prospect of a pre-election trial"".  The majority opinion, authored by Chief Justice Roberts, found that:

&gt;Under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of Presidential power entitles a former President to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority. And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts.

&gt;
&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court has unanimously reversed a Colorado supreme court ruling barring former President Donald J. Trump from its primary ballot. The opinion is a per curiam, meaning it is behalf of the entire court and not signed by any particular justice. However, the three liberal justices  Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson  filed their own joint opinion concurring in the judgment.

This debate is complicated by fascism's slippery nature, which can resemble authoritarianism, totalitarianism, or military dictatorships. Modern authoritarian regimes like Hungary and Russia further muddy the waters by maintaining the appearance of democracy through elections. Even as Republicans restrict voting rights, they argue that America remains fundamentally democratic. I aims to demonstrate that Trump meets the criteria of fascism using a comprehensive definition from Robert Paxton's ""The Anatomy of Fascism.""

# What is Fascism?

Paxton's definition of fascism in ""The Anatomy of Fascism"" is chosen for its comprehensive analysis and distinction between fascism and other authoritarian systems. It also divides fascism into stages and shows how they are achieved or how they fail. It helps the reader understand that fascism is not merely a cult of personality where Mussolini or Hitler and their policies define what fascism is. What Hitler and Mussolini did is often what defines so called ""liberal fascism"", while neglecting the other components that make up fascism. My use of this definition is to avoid such incomplete analysis.

According to Paxton:

&gt; ""Fascism may be defined as a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.""

This definition can be broken down into several key components:

1. Political behavior characterized by:
   - Obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood
   - Compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity
2. Mass-based party of nationalist militants collaborating uneasily with traditional elites
3. Abandonment of democratic liberties
4. Pursuit of internal cleansing and external expansion through redemptive violence, without ethical or legal restraints

# How is Trump A Fascist?
## Political BehaviorObsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation or victimhood

Here are there quotes from a recent Fox News interview with [Brian Kilmeade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5f-L4jWvUY) about Biden and Democrats:

&gt; ""He's absolutely destroyed this country.""

&gt; ""He's being laughed at by the leaders of foreign countries. It's ridiculous that he's our president.""

&gt; ""More about policy than anything else and these radical Democrats are all radical everyone that they're talking about is a radical left lunatic and whether it's Biden or whether it's somebody else I think it's the same. They want open borders they want all the things we just discussed and much more. No more gasoline powered cars. They want you to go all electric, which don't go far and made in China; very expensive. They, you know, as an example I say it's almost embarrassing to have to even say, they want men playing in women's sports.""

In this interview, Trump and his supporters paint Biden as a national embarrassment, whose policies are supposedly destroying America. They criticize Biden's stance on renewable energy, immigration, and transgender rights, framing these issues as evidence of America's decline. This narrative of national decay and embarrassment sets the stage for a sense of victimhood and persecution.

Trump and his base often portray themselves as victims of the media, claiming that the press unfairly targets and vilifies them. This belief is held regardless of whether they feel the criticism is deserved or not.

While these statements might not be strong indicators of fascism, they do provide insight into Trump's political behavior and his ability to shape public opinion by exploiting fears of decline and outsider threats.

## Political BehaviorCompensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity

This component, and the next, are crucial as they highlight that fascism is more than just a cult of personality, which is how it is often simplified in the media. By examining the behaviors and beliefs of those within Trump's circle, we can better assess whether he can be considered a fascist, regardless of his self-perception. 

Trump's description of the assassination attempt at the Republican National Convention (RNC) is telling: 

&gt; ""I raised my right arm, looked at the thousands and thousands of people breathlessly waiting, and started shouting [Fight! Fight! Fight!](https://youtu.be/aRUHMK9-gBg?feature=shared&amp;t=704)... When my clenched fist went up high into the air, the crowd realized I was okay and roared with pride for our country like no crowd I have ever heard before...""

Trump's interpretation of the event equates the crowd's enthusiasm for his survival with their passion for the nation. In Trump's narrative, he and the country are one and the same, indicating that he sees himself as the embodiment of a movement fueled by his unique vision for America. 

This sense of unity and purity is further emphasized in another quote from his RNC speech: 

&gt; ""Our resolve is unbroken, and our purpose is unchanged: to deliver a government that serves the American people better than ever before. Nothing will stop me in this mission because our vision is righteous and our cause is [pure](https://youtu.be/aRUHMK9-gBg?feature=shared&amp;t ordenó). No matter what obstacle comes our way, we will not break, we will not bend, we will not back down. And I will never stop fighting for you, your family, and our magnificent country. Never.""

Here, Trump presents himself and his supporters as righteous and pure, invoking religious notions to justify their political agenda. The fact that the RNC audience cheers on this statement despite its antithesis to democratic pluralism is concerning. Trump's rhetoric leaves no room for legitimate opposition, casting those who challenge him as impure or even unpatriotic. 

The support Trump receives from his base further solidifies this dynamic. Many Trump supporters at the RNC wore bandages on their ears in solidarity with him. Figures like Kid Rock, whose Instagram proclaimed, ""You fuck with Trump, you fuck with me!"" embody the loyalty of Trump's followers. The Republican Party's continued endorsement of Trump as their standard-bearer indicates their alignment with his vision for the country.

## Mass-based party of committed nationalists militants work in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites

Fascism is not merely about the figurehead but also about the social landscape surrounding him. Let's examine this aspect by starting with the relationship between far-right nationalists and traditional elites, which is often uneasy but can be functionally collaborative. 

Two recent examples from U.S. politics illustrate this dynamic: 

Firstly, consider the recent Republican National Convention (RNC) vote, where Mitch McConnell, a long-serving Senator and instrumental figure in conservative politics, [was booed by attendees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2rQ8zDF49U). McConnell embodies the definition of a traditional elite within the Republican Party. Despite his successful tenure in the Senate, including his role in securing two Supreme Court seats for conservative justices, he was met with disdain by RNC attendees. This reaction is particularly notable given the successful advancement of the conservative agenda through the Court, with landmark decisions such as the overturning of Roe v. Wade and Chevron deference. 

The second example is the insurrection attempt on January 6, 2021, led by Donald Trump and his supporters. Far-right militant groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were present and prepared to commit acts of violence. When former Vice President Mike Pence, a long-serving Republican and loyal supporter of Trump, declined to overturn the election results, these militants turned on him. Despite Pence's four years of service to the conservative movement, his adherence to the law was met with calls for his murder, with insurgents chanting, ""[Hang Mike Pence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCbTgDC14uY)."" 

This tenuous relationship between far-right nationalists and traditional elites is exemplified by these two cases. In the political arena, figures like Trump, McConnell, and Pence share a common vision for the country. However, outside these halls, Trump can leverage the support of far-right militants to exert pressure on more moderate conservatives, as seen during the insurrection attempt. Traditional elites like McConnell and Pence benefit from the support of the far-right base while also needing to maintain a delicate balance to avoid backlash. 

In this context, Donald Trump serves as a central figure, navigating both worlds and utilizing them to further his agenda.

## Abandons democratic liberties

This criterion expands our understanding of fascist aims beyond just Trump or his supporters, highlighting how fascism poses a direct threat to democratic institutions and the liberties they guarantee. In Trump's statement about the purity of his cause, he emphasizes his determination to overcome any obstacle, including those posed by democracy and the rule of law. 

Trump has suggested that, if reelected, [he might weaponize the FBI](https://www.youtube.com/live/nID5J8dmRL4?t=900s), despite acknowledging the potential consequences for American democracy. A leader committed to preserving democratic norms would instead ensure the lawful punishment of political enemies, thereby upholding democratic liberties and avoiding any actions that could endanger the nation. 

Since losing the 2020 election, Trump has consistently denied the validity of the results, claiming without evidence that the election was stolen. This rejection of election results undermines the most fundamental aspect of democracy. What makes this particularly egregious is that Trump is willing to abandon democratic liberties in his pursuit of power. Trump and his allies are already laying the groundwork to challenge the 2024 election results, citing unsubstantiated concerns of fraud. 

In another concerning development, the conservative-leaning Supreme Court, in *Trump v. United States*, ruled that the President [""may not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers"" and is ""entitled to presumptive immunity from prosecution for his official acts.""](https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/donald-trump-immunity-supreme-court/2024/07/01/id/1170836/) This decision [effectively places the Office of the President above the law](https://campaignlegal.org/press-releases/clc-responds-us-supreme-court-decision-trump-v-united-states), preventing accountability for the most powerful position in the nationa departure from democratic principles. 

Additionally, [Trump has vowed to deport up to 11 million undocumented immigrants using the military](https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/donald-trump-military-deport/2024/04/30/id/1162902/), a plan that violates the Posse Comitatus Act. This Act prohibits the involvement of federal troops in civilian law enforcement. However, Trump has disregarded this Act, stating that undocumented immigrants are not civilians but rather ""people that aren't legally in our country."" 

Trump's brand of fascism sacrifices democratic liberties and norms to serve his pursuit and retention of power. He seeks revenge on political enemies, disregarding the legal justifications, and works to ""purify"" the nation. That last clause might be a strong phrase but....

## Pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion

Trump's [characterization of immigrants](https://youtu.be/sikEBPEa8WY?feature=shared&amp;t=222) reveals a lot about his perspective and intentions: 

&gt; ""They're poisoning the blood of our country...They've poisoned mental institutions and prisons all over the world...They're coming into our country from Africa, from Asia...all over the world they're pouring into our country."" 

By describing immigrants as ""poison,"" Trump implies that removing them would have a purifying or healing effect on the nation. Immigration is a significant issue for conservatives, and they are likely receptive to Trump's plan of action. Similarly, during his Veterans Day speech in New Hampshire, he vowed to:

&gt; ""Root out the Communists, Marxists, fascists, and the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country...[They] lie and cheat and steal on elections, and will do anything possible, whether legal or illegal, to destroy America and the American dream."" 

Trump's rhetoric has been identified as echoing Nazi language. Critics often argue that using Nazi rhetoric does not necessarily make one a Nazi, and thus the left's concerns are overblown. However, this component of fascist behavior is about the means fascists employ to achieve their goals. In Trump's case, how does he intend to ""root out"" these people or deport immigrants? As discussed previously, he has shown little regard for legal constraints, and his actions are likely to violate democratic norms. 

The specter of violence looms large within Trump's rhetoric, and with a cause he deems pure and righteous, along with followers eager to act, the potential for violent outcomes increases. Similarly, Kevin Robert, President of the Heritage Foundation and an acquaintance of Trump, has characterized the ""radical left"" as ""[coming for *your* freedom, *your* God-given rights, and our national soul.](https://youtu.be/qw9AT6WAEJo?feature=shared&amp;t=12)"" Robert further [asserted](https://www.mediamatters.org/project-2025/heritage-foundation-president-celebrates-supreme-court-immunity-decision-we-are): 

&gt; ""We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,"" 

Here, Robert strongly insinuates that he and his far-right militants are prepared for redemptive violence to restore their vision of America. Trump's rhetoric and that of his far-right allies indicate a readiness to employ violence in pursuit of their version of the ""American dream,"" raising serious concerns about the potential for future unrest and the erosion of democratic norms.

# Trump is a Fascist

To sum it up, Trump's narrative consistently revolves around the idea of national decline and humiliation, cultivating a sense of victimhood among his supporters. He evokes religious notions of purity and unity, entwining his personal interests with the nation's, which leaves no room for legitimate democratic opposition. Trump's false claim of election fraud and his disregard for democratic institutions, norms, and liberties further bolster the case for his fascist tendencies. 

Indeed, one of the clearest indicators of Trump's authoritarian inclinations is his pursuit of power with no ethical or legal restraints. His rhetoric demonizes immigrants and his political opponents, using Nazi phrases like they're his own. Trump's loyal base of committed nationalist militants includes far-right groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, who were present during the January 6 insurrection. In concert, they pose a direct threat to democratic ideals. Traditional elites within the Republican Party, though maintaining an uneasy relationship with these militants, ultimately benefit from and contribute to Trump's fascist agenda. As Kevin Robert, an acquaintance of Trump's, insinuated, Trump and his followers are prepared to use redemptive violence to realize their vision for America.

As always, my mom had Fox News playing on the TV. As always, I ignored it and tended to my kids, waiting for the right time to ask her to put on Disney+. 

Im sitting there, nursing my newborn when she suddenly says, I hope youre voting.

I am.

I hope youre voting for the RIGHT person.

I told her I believe I am. That that right person doesnt believe it trying to control my body or my daughters bodies. 

That set her off, she proceeded to yell at me for 10+ minutes about how Kamala is a Communist and how illegals are killing and raping people everyday. I brought up how Trumps a fascist and how there are far more legal citizens who rape and murder people in this country. Deaf ears. 

The whole debate ended with her asking if I was r*tarded. In front of my kids. Who were staring at her in absolute shock and confusion. I told her, if you cannot control yourself, I will no longer be bringing the kids here. They dont need to be exposed to this. That shut her up. 

My brother showed up around this time. Hes the baby and only boy (the favorite). Hes also very liberal. My mom didnt speak another word about the election. 

We ended up leaving an hour later. As Im packing the kids up in the car, my mom apologizes to me. 

Im sorry I upset you. Im just very passionate about this. 

My mom and I have never agreed on politics. Ive been left-leaning since I could understand the differences between the two parties. But its NEVER been like this until that orange fucking asshole came onto the scene. He has turned his followers into a cult, a cult that is willing to alienate family and friends to vindicate themselves. 

Im writing this at 4am because I cant sleep due to this experience. A part of me wants to cut my mom off. It seems the logical thing to do. But the other part of me loves my mother and I dont want to lose her. 

I hate this election. I hate politics. I hate Trump. I hate how he has divided this country with his hateful rhetoric and lies. Fuck him and anyone who believes his shit.

"2024-09-16",1726491740,"CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy.","If you're voting for Trump in the 2024 election, it suggests that you either have a lack of understanding about what has happened over the last decade and have been subject to misinformation, or are actively against democracy. 

There is a minority of Trump-voters who would like to see another system in place than the current system of democratic values, because they think their values and ideals are more important than democracy. Those who would rather live in a tyranny or other aristocratic system, as long as their needs and values are met. 

The vast part of the republican voters does not want to get rid of democracy - nor is it in their best interest - and are just un- or misinformed about current events. Even if your opinions are generally in line with most of the things Trump stands for, and you're actively opposed to everything Harris stands for, it should not matter since one side does not adhere to democratic values and the other does. I understand that a lot of information that people in the US get is heavily colored in favour of one candidate or the other

All of this has been made especially clear since January 6th; if you support a candidate that attempted to commit a coup d'était, you want to subvert democracy, or you don't have the correct information to make an informed choice.

I'm open to discussion and reconsidering my views if presented with new insights, as ""they're all misinformed or authoritarian"" feels overly simplistic. My perspective comes from observing recent events, but I'm curious to see whether my view is shaped by the news I receive or if theres a more nuanced explanation.

Disclaimer: I'm not from the U.S. and don't align with either the Democratic or Republican parties.","changemyview",4753,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fi41o4/cmv_voting_for_donald_trump_in_the_2024_election/"

In the Republican caucus this week, I am not going to be able to support the candidacy of Donald Trump.

As Republicans, we believe in upholding the Constitution and the rule of law.  Yet Trump attempted to subvert the Constitution by trying to get Mike Pence to nullify the will of the electors.  He additionally put pressure on state election officials to find him more votes or not certify results. 

Now, unbelievably, Trump is trying to defend his reprehensible conduct by arguing that, unless the President is found guilty in an impeachment trial, he cant be held liable for crimes committed in office.  Think about that.  Trump actually thinks the President should be above the law.

Trump has a long history of immoral, unethical, and dishonest behavior that, if engaged in by a Democrat, Republicans would be calling for his ouster.  So why are we giving Trump a pass? 

Do we no longer believe character matters?  Is it now just about advancing our agenda by any means possible?  If we nominate Trump again it will show we are a party that has lost its moral compass, and is not deserving of the trust of the American people.

Tomorrow, he will expand on this vision in a primetime interview with Lester Holt.

United States, a Case About Presidential Immunity From Prosecution","[Per Oyez](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2023/23-939), the questions at issue in today's case are: ""Does a former president enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office, and if so, to what extent?""

Oral argument is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. Eastern.

"2024-05-11",1715434868,"MMW: Trump will lose by 20 million+ votes and the race will be called for Biden on Election Night
","EDIT: Insert whoever the Democratic nominee will be. People didn't vote for Joe Biden in 2020 because he was Joe Biden. They voted for him because he wasn't Donald Trump. Same will be true in 2024. 

As the title suggests, Trump will lose by 20 million+ votes and the networks will call the race for Biden on election night. Here's why:

1. Polls showing Trump leading Biden in swing states are selectively sampled and meant to scare you into consuming more news. Remember the ""red wave"" of 2022 that never materialized?
2. Repeatedly, voters have rejected Trump. In 2022, ALL of his statewide, Ultra MAGA, Trump-endorsed candidates lost in swing states where voters tend to be more moderate. See: Kari Lake, Adam Laxalt, Blake Masters, Dr. Oz, Herschel Walker, Doug Mastriano, David Perdue, etc.
3. When voters actually vote, this is what happens: Trump lost 130k votes in the (open) GOP primary earlier this week in Indiana. He lost 158k votes in the (closed) GOP primary a few weeks ago in Pennsylvania. Let that sink in: 158k Republican voters showed up to a primary in a race that's been over for months to actively vote against Trump.
4. Most Republicans will likely plug their nose and vote Trump. But the only states that matter are AZ, NV, PA, WI, MI, and GA. And if hes losing this many votes in ruby-red Indiana, how many more will he lose in the swing states that have a more moderate makeup?
5. Trump needs to flip Democrat and Independent votes that he didnt get in those swing states in 2020, which hes clearly not going to do. So hell lose even if he gets 100% of the Republican votes. And if even the smallest fraction of Republicans burn a vote with RFK, dont vote, or vote Biden, Trump will get absolutely demolished in those swing states.

"2024-07-17",1721192104,"From This Life-Long Republican to Another:","This isn't about Republicans vs. Democrats.  This is about corruption, religious extremism (nationalism), the reputation of the United States on the global stage, and the legitimacy of the Presidential Office and democracy.  It's about upholding the Constitution, Woman's Rights, my Daughter's rights, and future Granddaughter's rights.  It's about our national security and maintaining our position as the country ""you do not f*ck with."" For me, this is about not letting a sick minded narcissist unravel the wisdom of our founding fathers so he can squander the American Empire and our economy... just like he squandered his own father's real estate empire he inherited and drove himself into bankruptcy repeatedly... then defrauded banks along the way with lies about the portfolios value, hiding his tax returns from us all and committing fraud while he slept with a porn star while his pregnant wife sat at home alone, preparing to give birth thinking she was ""the only one for him.""  Why is a piece of cr*p like Trump not good enough for your sister or your daughter... somehow good enough to be the president and trusted with your job security, your financial future, our economy, our physical security, and your rights... while he suggests injecting yourself with kitchen cleaners and ammonia as some sort of COVID medicine?? =   ENOUGH!!  It's not funny to put the village idiot in the Oval Office.  This is deadly serious. Nobody understands that better than US military service members.  I don't care if you don't like me... or the person standing next to you or your job or your boss or this message.  It's time to vote responsibly for everyone's future here in the USA. Or there may not be a USA.  Vote for anyone but Trump.  Find another outlet for your hate and frustration of the system... Trump is not the solution to those issues.  Not this time around.  Voting  for Trump and Future 2025 is voting for anarchy.  He wants to remove the checks and balances governing the Presidential Office our founding fathers put in place to prevent monarchs and oligarchs from suppressing the free people of the United States and killing Democracy.  Please sit down and think about that before you vote.  Life can and will get a lot worse for us all if you vote for Trump.  Remember, inflation began to rise during his term in Office, and we still don't have it under control.  High inflation leads to job losses, businesses closing, home sales plummeting, home prices falling from a lack of sales, which always proceeds large stock market declines, and soooo much more.  Please be a part of the solution, and don't make things worse.  There will be a time to vote for another Republican candidate.  2024 is NOT that election.  I am not saying this to offend anyone.  Least of all, my fellow Idahoans.  Or my fellow Americans and Patriots.  You are my countrymen.  You are my neighbors.  You are all smart enough to think for yourselves.  Trump's  Future 2025 wants to abolish the Department of Education, eliminate advanced degrees that lead to large incomes and wealth for your family.  Are you actually OK with him taking away those opportunities from you??  The plan is to keep younger generations dumb... like the children of Afghanistan  who can't go to school, so your children will not be able to question authority.   Or think for themselves and act for themselves. Vote for Anyone... just not Trump.  The USA is not Afghanistan.  We are not the Taliban.  White supremacy will not be achieved with Trump as president.  The US won't even be respected on the global stage.  Those are the facts.

We're all exhausted. Let's be done with the chaos that Trump brings and come together for our great country! There's hope in Harris's campaign! A vote for Harris is a vote for a UNITED nation. 

Some quotes from last night's debate:

Hope for America

Harris: ""I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people, and that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy.""

Roe v. Wade

Harris: When Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe v. Wade, as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. & I think the American people believe that certain freedoms, the freedom to make decisions about ones own body, should not be made by the government.

Jan. 6th

Harris: Donald Trump was fired by 81 million people, so lets be clear about that, and clearly he is having a very difficult time processing that, but we cannot afford to have a President of the United States as he did in the past to the will of the voters in a free and fair election.

Trump is unfit

Harris: [Trumps] former National Security Advisor has said he is dangerous and unfit. His former Secretary of Defense has said the nation, the Republic, would never survive another Trump term. And when we listen to this kind of rhetoric, when the issues that affect the American people are not being addressed, I think the choice is clear in the election.

To add to this point over 200 former Republican presidential staffers, including Dick Cheney, of all people, back Harris. 

Let's look forward and be done with Trump!

One effect of this, [per NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-decide-trumps-immunity-claim-election-interference-case-rcna139026), will be that ""the courts intervention adds a further delay, meaning his trial will not start for weeks, if not months"".

Hes my hero, Helen Comperatore told the Post. He just said get down! That was the last thing he said.

The Comperatore family attended Saturdays rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, as CNN previously reported. Helen told the Post that she and Corey were childhood sweethearts who were about to celebrate their 29th wedding anniversary when the family headed to the rally to support former president Donald Trump.

Me and the kids were all there as a family, she said. He was just excited. It was going to be a nice day with the family.

It was a bad day, she added.

Helen told the Post that President Joe Biden tried to call her, but she declined to speak to him since her husband was a devout Republican, and he would not have wanted me to talk to him.

But she added that she does not hold the current president responsible for what happened to her family.

I dont have any ill will towards Joe Biden, she said. Im not one of those people that gets involved in politics. I support Trump, thats who Im voting for, but I dont have ill-will towards Biden.

He didnt do anything to my husband. A 20-year-old despicable kid did, she continued.

[Brung up most recently by Liz Cheney](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/us/politics/liz-cheney-republican-party.html), a lot of conservative Republicans like myself don't feel like they could support the current GOP, or even think that it can recover from the MAGA virus. It leaves a lot of us displaced and without a party to truly call home. I will be voting blue come November, but I don't feel as if I can truly call the Democratic party MY party.  
It leaves me nostalgic for those seemingly long-lost days where Republicans and Democrats could come together in actual, thought-provoking discussion to further the interest of the United States as a whole, not just for themselves and party loyalties.   
I already plan to enter politics and hopefully elected office, and I've been pitching such an idea to a few friends of mine that are also like me: lifelong conservatives who hate Trump with the fiery passion of a thousand suns.    
It has a ways to go in regards to policy, but I have the name down: the New Conservative Party of America  
Whether or not it'll be viable as a third-party option, I'm not sure (probably not, but doesn't hurt to try lol), but I hope it'll attract those moderates/unaffiliated people across the political spectrum.   
What do ya'll think of a new party for conservatives?

"2024-04-06",1712367552,"My boomer mom begs me to vote for Trump or not vote at all, then tells me to renounce my citizenship if I won't vote the way she wants","Context: I am 33 fucking years old, I have a kid, I was born in the USA and immigrated to Canada to be with my husband. My kid is Canadian. I recently was awarded Canadian citizenship, which I am really fucking thankful for, so therefore I am a dual citizen. I still vote in US elections (and will be voting in Canadian elections now too!).

When my Mom was visiting, we got into it regarding politics. Most of the time, she tiptoes and tries to bring it up, and I am pretty mean and shut her down right away, so she ends up saying, ""Let's just change the subject!"" This time I wasn't forceful enough and we got into an argument.

For months she has been begging me to vote for Trump or not at all. Ever since I applied for Canadian citizenship, she has been freaking out thinking that it means I lose my American citizenship - it doesn't, and I kept explaining that to her, and she begged me to please keep my American citizenship. Which I planned to.

Then during our argument she told me the same shit - please do me this favor and vote for Trump or don't vote at all. She already said everyone apparently loves him and that he's going to win, and I reminded her of that, and then I told her it's my right as an American citizen to vote and it's not right for her to try and control or take it away from me. Then she told me that I might as well renounce my citizenship if I am going to vote for Biden. She also informed me I have no right to vote because I didn't ""struggle like she did"" so therefore I don't know what I am talking about.

By ""struggle like she did"", she means as a single mom working a full-time job. I am fortunate that I am a stay-at-home mom supported by an awesome husband, but unlike her, I have a child with a disability, which she never had to deal with, so I am a SAHM for a reason and it comes with it's own challenges.

And yeah I can definitely look at what she said and think how stupid to try and gatekeep ""struggling"". How stupid to ask me not to vote when she is so certain he will win. How stupid to snap at me to renounce my citizenship and basically choose Trump over her family. But as a human being and daughter, I'm pretty damn hurt over the whole thing. Because yeah she basically just told me where her priorities are, and that I am worthless in her eyes because I didn't ""struggle"" like she did, so I will never be good enough. So that was a fun visit. Thanks for letting me vent a bit.

Oh she also told me the ""Democrats are trying to abort full-term babies"" so that was interesting. I literally didn't know how to reply to that one because I was so dumbstruck by the level of stupid.

"2023-10-04",1696419935,"CMV: Most Biden Supporters aren't voting for Biden because they like him or his policies, they just hate Trump and the GOP","Reuploaded because I made an error in the original post

As Joe Biden and Donald Trump are signifcant favourites to lead both their respective parties into the 2024 election. So I think it's fair to say that the 2024 US election will be contested between these 2 candidates. I know Trump is going through some legal issues, but knowing rich, white billionaires, he'll probably be ok to run in 2024
  

  
Reading online forums and news posts has led me to believe that a signifcant portion of those who voted for Biden in 2020, and will vote for him again 2024 aren't doing so because they like him and his policies, but rather, they are doing so because they do not support Donald Trump, or any GOP nomination.
  

  
I have a couple of reasons for believing this. Of course as it is the nature of the sub. I am open to having these reasons challenged
  

  
\-Nearly every time voting for Third Parties is mentioned on subs like r/politics, you see several comments along the lines of ""Voting Third Party will only ensure Trump wins."" This seems to be a prevailing opinion among many Democrats, and Biden supporters. I believe that this mentality is what spurs many left wingers and centrists who do NOT support Biden into voting for him. As they are convincted that voting for their preferred option could bolster Trump
  

  
\-A Pew Research poll (link: https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/election-2020-voters-are-highly-engaged-but-nearly-half-expect-to-have-difficulties-voting/?utm\_content=buffer52a93&amp;utm\_medium=social&amp;utm\_source=twitter.com&amp;utm\_campaign=buffer ) suggets up to 56% of Biden voters are simply voting for him because they don't want Trump in office. It's possible to suggest this is a mood felt among a similar portion of Biden voters, but then again, the poll only had \~2,000 responses. Regardless, I seem to get the feeling that a lot of Biden's supporters are almost voting out of spite for Trump and the GOP.
  

  
Here's a CBC article on the same topic (https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-joe-biden-u-s-election-loathing-love-1.5798122)
  

  
\-Biden's opinion polls have been poor, very poor. With some sources putting his approval rating as low as 33%, I find it hard to believe therefore that he'll receive votes from tens of millions of Americans because they all love him. Are opinion polls entirely reliable? No. But do they provide a President with a general idea of what the public thinks of then? In my opinion, yes. How can a President gain 270 electoral votes and the majority of the population's support when he struggles to gain 40%+ in approval ratings. For me, this is a clear sign of many people just choosing him not because they like Biden, but because they just don't want the GOP alternative.

In an election season that for so long just seemed like a choice between the lesser of the evils, there is finally something good worth voting for. 

Governor Shapiro gave a fantastic speech in which he thoroughly endorsed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, and said he will do everything he can to get them elected. 

Then Kamala Harris gave an impassioned speech in which she extolled the virtues of her new running matehis military service, his career as a high school teacher and football coach, his public service as a congressman and governor.

She also spoke of the things they want to do to make this country betteraffordable housing, affordable health care, building an economy where everyone has the chance to own a home, start a business, and build wealth, defending the freedom to vote, to be free from gun violence, to love who you love openly and with pride, to make your own reproductive choices.

The final speaker was Tim Walz.  In a down-to-earth way, relatable to so many Americans, he explained why Trump and Vance are bad for the country.  This is a man who, from his background, has a lot in common with the average MAGA supporter.  Yet here he was condemning Trumps criminality and the push by Republicans to take away basic freedoms.

Freedom is really what this election is about.  We are in a dangerous era where people are actually praising the idea of presidential immunity, and trying to take away freedoms of those they disagree with.  Its good to know we still have candidates who remember what America is supposed to be about.

It's an idea, which is a 1000x harder. Call it what you will, Facism, Theocracy,  whatever. This Presidential horse race is maybe 10% of defeating it. The other 90% is happening right under your nose at your City Council, board of education, local and statewide elections. Nothing gets done in this country without Congress. And right now they're all a bunch of crayon eating monkeys.

Trump is a sad old sack. He probably wouldn't make it to the end of his presidency. He is also not very smart. JD Vance on the other hand is an Ivy league educated venture capitalist that was able to convince everyone is ""from the people""  The Guy is smart AND evil. There's 1000 more of these assholes where he came from.

Kamala is not your savior. Sure, I'll be voting for her. But she is just one person. Nobody is coming to save us. We have to save ourselves.

This isn't just unusual, it's suspicious. For decades, releasing tax returns has been a standard practice, allowing voters to ensure transparency, avoid conflicts of interest, and assess a candidate's financial integrity. Biden and Harris have both released decades of their tax returns ([26 and 20 years, respectively](https://www.taxnotes.com/presidential-tax-returns?from=0&amp;year=)). Even Ramaswamy has released 19 years of his.

Neither Trump or JD Vance have released theirs. But why not? What do they have to lose?

"2024-08-24",1724509572,"MMW: Texas will flip blue this election","People are going to call me crazy for this prediction, but I think there is a very real possibility that we'll see Texas flip blue this election. I was unsure for a couple of weeks and I never really thought it was too likely, but now I'm starting to think it can happen, especially post-DNC.

I feel like there is a common misconception surrounding the idea that Texas is a solidly red state. A very popular stereotype is that most Texans are very redneck and conservative. The truth is that Texas is more of a low turnout state. Texas had the lowest voter turnout out of all 50 states in the 2020 election, with only 51% of eligible Texas voters showing up to vote. Additionally, Biden only lost the state by *600,000 votes* in 2020. While that may seem like a lot of votes, it really isn't when it comes to elections. On top of that, most of the big cities in Texas are VERY left-leaning and according to the Pew Research Center, there's slightly more registered Democrat voters than Republican voters in Texas. ([Source](https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/database/state/texas/party-affiliation/)). Texas seems to be shifting more and more left with each passing election cycle, and I think it will only be a matter of time until the state becomes fully blue.

Now I've been seeing an overwhelming amount of doubt amongst people online. A LOT of people are of the opinion that the state simply CAN'T be blue this election. And personally, I couldn't disagree more. I'm expecting this election to have an even higher voter turnout than the numbers we saw in 2020. I think the problem with the last two presidential Dem candidates was that there was almost zero excitement for Hillary and even Biden. Most of the people who voted for them were mostly voting against Trump. With Kamala Harris, there seems to be actual enthusiasm and Democrats are more energized than ever to vote for their candidate. I think that her being the new nominee will encourage a lot of people to go out and vote, and that includes a lot of the Democrats down in Texas. I think that just having a nominee that so many people are excited for is enough to make a huge difference. And when turnout is high, Democrats always win. On the flip side, I also think Trump fatigue is a very real thing and people seem to be growing tired of the same old lies and conspiracy theories that him and his base continue to push. It has resulted in several Republicans completely turning on him, especially after the insurrection on January 6th.

While Texas was one of the many states affected by the red wave in 2022, I really don't think it changes much when you consider that presidential elections historically have much higher voter turnout than midterms. And when you combine that with the amount of hate that Republicans like Ted Cruz have been getting over there, I feel like now is the perfect opportunity for the state to flip blue. I also just can't help but feel like people are just gonna keep saying that Texas will turn blue NEXT election until it eventually does at some point.

Call me foolishly optimistic, but I really think Texas is in play. If Kamala held even just one rally in Texas and paid for some ads to play over there, I think the lone star state can certainly be in reach. If you need anymore convincing, I'd recommend checking this article out [here](https://www.lonestarleft.com/p/will-texas-ever-turn-blue-heres-what) if you haven't already. Even though I'm feeling optimistic, I don't want anybody to be complacent. I still encourage everybody to go out and vote, especially to the Democrats down in Texas. If Kamala wins that state, I can't even begin to describe how amazing that would be for Democrats.","MarkMyWords",1647,"https://www.reddit.com/r/MarkMyWords/comments/1f06iu9/mmw_texas_will_flip_blue_this_election/"

Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her Vice Presidential nominee, and weve got a phenomenal ticket - just as we have excellent  candidates down ballot, too. 

**Kamala Harris &amp; Tim Walz**

In 2020, Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris to run as his Vice President.

The child of immigrants, Kamala Harris graduated Howard University and spent her early career serving her community as prosecutor, then assistant district attorney. 

She spent her time in California rising through the ranks - District Attorney, then the states Attorney General (the first women, African American and South Asian American to hold the AG office), before being elected Senator. 

Ultimately, Kamala Harris would be on the winning ticket that finally kicked Donald Trump out of office, being elected Vice President in 2020.

***And now, she'll do it again.***

With Tim Walzs help. 

A teacher, member of the National Guard, a football coach and then House Rep (for a red district, for twelve years!), since 2019 Walz has been an incredibly effective governor of Minnesota. 

And heres something awesome: if we elect the Harris/Walz ticket, Walzs old job goes to his Lt. Gov Penny Flanagan, who will be the first native American Women to hold the office, and will be incredible in her own right.

Now, lets take inspiration. In 2022, we worked hard and gave Walz a trifecta in Minnesota - and hes been able to pass awesome, progressive initiatives in that state. Lets welcome him to his new job - with a trifecta federally. 

Lets deliver the Harris/Walz campaign the House, and lets keep the Senate.

**The Senate**:

**Arizona**: Ruben Gallego is running against Kari Lake for the seat currently held by retiring Senator Kyrsten Sinema. Arizona has rapidly trended blue, electing Senator Mark Kelly in 2022 by 5%. Our margin in Arizona has only grown in Senate elections since 2018, and with crazy election deniers (who lost the 2022 Arizona Gov and 2020 Presidential races) on the ballot, we hope the trend continues!

**Florida**: Former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is challenging Sen. Rick Scott. He was originally elected in 2018 by a margin of just 10,000 votes. With abortion and marijuana amendments to the state constitution on the ballot this year, we're hopefully we can kick Scott out of his seat and send Senate Republicans into even more of a tailspin.

**Maryland**: In this traditionally safe-blue state, Angela Alsobrooks is running against popular former Governor, Republican Larry Hogan. We expect Alsobrooks to win and become the first black senator from Maryland, but Hogan could make this more of a challenge than anticipated.

**Michigan**: Popular Sen. Debbie Stabenow decided to retire. Rep. Elissa Slotkin has run an amazing campaign and we expect her to comfortably win the primary on August 6th. She's expected to face former Rep. Mike Rogers in the general election.

**Montana**: 3-term Democratic Senator Jon Tester, who was narrowly re-elected in 2018 with just 50.3% of the vote, is running for re-election against Tim Sheehy. Tester occupies our most likely loss this cycle; his margin has dwindled over the years as Montana has trended away from us. Still, with a good fight and a little bit of luck, we can win this seat a 4th time!

**Nebraska**: Independent Dan Osborn is challenging Senator Deb Fischer. Osborn is a former Democrat, leaving the party in 2016, and is running on a platform that largely aligns with our own. Local Democrats have not filed a candidate or organized a write-in campaign, and it is expected that Osborn would caucus with us should he be elected (like Senators Bernie Sanders and Angus King).

**Nevada**: Sen. Jacky Rosen is running for a 2nd term against Republican Sam Brown, after narrowly winning election in 2018. Nevada has a fairly small population, largely centered in Las Vegas, and the Covid-19 Pandemic was especially harmful to the state; Sen. Cortez Masto was re-elected here in 2022, but Gov. Sisolak was not. With Trump on the ballot, Nevada is looking like it will be a tight race for Sen. Rosen.

**Ohio**: Popular 3-term Senator Sherrod Brown is running for re-election against general crazy person Bernie Moreno. In 2022, Moreno ran in the GOP primary before being defeated by the very weird JD Vance. Polling has recently shown Senator Brown running decently ahead of Moreno, although its still expected to be quite close.

**Pennsylvania**: 3-term Senator Bob Casey Jr. is running for re-election against David McCormick. Another 2022 Senate loser, McCormick didn't make it out of the Pennsylvania GOP primaries, where he lost to Dr. Oz. Polling has shown Senator Casey Jr. with a comfortable lead over McCormick, though Pennsylvania's status as the preeminent swing state has everyone's attention here -- Hopefully, to our benefit.

**Texas**: US Rep. Colin Allred is running to stop Senator Ted Cruz from securing a 3rd term of ignoring his constituents and fleeing to Cancun when things get tough. Cruz narrowly won re-election in 2018 with 51% of the vote. With Texas's shifting demographics, Ted Cruz's wild unpopularity, and the Texas Democratic Party working to organize a state-wide campaign for the first time in decades, we hope to flip this seat and deliver Texas the representation it deserves.

**Wisconsin**: 2-term Senator Tammy Baldwin is running for a 3rd term. She was re-elected in 2018 with 55% of the vote and likely helped Governor Tony Evers win his first term in the office. Her opponent is expected to be hedge fund manager Eric Hovde, who also ran for the GOP nomination back in 2012.

**The House, Defense**:

**Colorado's 8th** (PVI Even): Rep. Caraveo is running for re-election. She was first elected in 2022 by just 0.7%, following the creation of the district! She's expected to face Republican State House Rep. Gabe Evans.

**Maine's 2nd** (PVI R+6): Rep. Golden is running for a 4th term against Republican State House Rep. Austin Theriault.

**Michigan's 7th** (R+2): Our presumptive nominee is Curtis Hertel Jr. He's expected to face former State Senator Tom Barrett.

**Michigan's 8th** (R+1): Rep. Kildee declined to run for re-election. The primary is scheduled for August 24th, with State Senator Kristen McDonald Rivet polling ahead of Mayor Matthew Collier, of Flint, Michigan. Polling in the Republican primary typically shows former Fox 47 anchor Paul Junge in the lead.

**North Carolina's 1st** (R+1): Rep. Davis is running for a second term against business owner Laurie Buckhout. Davis was elected in 2022 with 52.4% of the vote.

**New Mexico's 2nd** (D+1), Rep. Gabe Vasquez is facing a 2022 rematch with former Rep. Yvette Herrel. He was elected in 2022 by 0.7% of the vote.

**Ohio's 9th** (R+3): Rep. Kaptur is running for re-election in a seat she has held for 42 years. Redistricting in 2020 turned this seat from Safe Dem to tossup, but in 2022 Kaptur was re-elected by 13%. She is facing State Rep. Derek Merrin.

**Ohio's 13th** (R+1): Rep. Sykes is running for a second term. This seat was vacated by Tim Ryan, as he won the Democratic nomination for US Senate. Sykes was elected by 5% in 2022, and this year faces former State Senator Kevin Coughlin.

**Pennsylvania's 7th** (R+2): Rep. Wild is running for re-election against State Rep. Ryan Mackenzie. Wild was originally elected in 2018 by a margin of 10%, though the district was altered in 2020 and she won re-election in 2022 by just 2%.

**Pennsylvania's 8th** (R+4): Rep. Cartwright is running for a seventh term against businessman Rob Bresnahan Jr. PA-08 became slightly more liberal in 2020 redistricting, allowing Cartwright to hold on to it by a 2% margin.

**Washington's 3rd** (R+5): Rep. Gluesenkamp Perez is running to hold on to a seat that she defeated Joe Kent for in 2022. This seat was previously held by Republican Jaime Herrera Beutler, who lost the primary as a result of her vote in favor of impeaching Donald Trump. Her opponent in 2024 is expected to be Joe Kent.

**The House, Offense**:

**Arizona's 1st** (R+2): Former State Rep. Amish Shah is running to unseat David Schweikert. Schweikert won re-election in 2022 by 0.8%.

**Arizona's 6th** (R+3): Kristen Engel is running to unseat Juan Ciscomani. This district was renumbered in 2020 and former Rep Ann Kirkpatrick declined to run. Ciscomani was elected by 1.4% in 2022.

**California's 13th** (D+4): Adam Gray is running to unseat John Duarte. A rematch from 2022, Duarte won by 584 votes.

**California's 22nd** (D+5): Rudy Salas is running to unseat David Valadao. Valadao was elected in 2022 by 3%.

**California's 27th** (D+4): George Whitesides is running to unseat Mike Garcia. Garcia was originally elected in 2020 and won re-election by 6% in 2022.

**California's 41st** (R+3): Will Rollins is running to unseat Ken Calvert. Originally elected in 1992 to the then-43rd district, Calvert defeated Rollins by 5% in 2022.

**New Jersey's 7th** (R+1): Sue Altman is running to unseat Thomas Kean Jr. This district was re-drawn in 2020 to be more conservative, allowing Kean Jr. to defeat our incumbent, Tom Malinowski, by 3% on his second try.

**New York's 4th** (D+5): Laura Gillen is running to unseat Anthony D'Esposito. This seat was held by Democrat Kathleen Rice, who declined to run for re-election in 2022. D'Esposito beat Gillen in 2022 by 3.6%.

**New York's 17th** (D+3): Mondaire Jones is running to unseat Mike Lawler in the district that elected him 2020. In 2022, Lawler defeated Sean Patrick Maloney by 0.6%.

**New York's 19th** (R+1): Josh Riley is running to unseat Marc Molinaro. In 2022, Molinaro defeated Riley by under 5,000 votes.

**Oregon's 5th** (D+2): Janelle Bynum is running to unseat Lori Chavez-DeRemer. In 2022, Chavez-DeRemer defeated Jamie McLeod-Skinner by 2%.

**Whats next?**

We get back to work. As you can see, the enthusiasm for the Harris/Walz ticket is palpable, and the campaign is kicking butts with fundraising. But were eager for our downballot Dems to not miss out on the momentum.

Donald Trump says he'll release names of a string of high-profile men - said to include several Brits - who visited sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's Caribbean island if he's re-elected in November

Jeffrey Epsteins secret circle of high-profile men who visited his private Caribbean island has been sent into a blind panic after Donald Trump vowed hed release their names. 

For decades, only a handful of men, including the paedophiles pal Prince Andrew, are known to have visited Little Saint James. But now, dozens of the rich and powerful - which The Mirror can reveal includes several Brits who have so far lived under a cloak of anonymity - are now fearful they could be identified if Trump is re-elected in November. 

While appearing on the Lex Fridman podcast in the States, the host accused the former president of hesitating to reveal who visited the island previously. There's a moment where you had some hesitation about Epstein releasing some of the documents on Epstein. Why the hesitation? Fridman asked.

Trump replied: I don't think I had... I mean, I'm not involved. I never went to his island, fortunately. But a lot of people did. The host then says: Why do you think so many smart, powerful people allowed him to get so close?

Trump responded: He was a good salesman, a hailing, hardy guy, and he had some nice assets that he'd throw around like islands. But a lot of big people went to that island. But fortunately, I was not one of them. 
Fridman said, ""Its just very strange for a lot of people that the list of clients that went to the island has not been made public. Trump replied: Yeah, it's very interesting isn't it? It probably will be, by the way. I'd certainly take a look at it. He then added: But yeah, I'd be inclined to do the Epstein.

The Wall Street financier, who was charged with sex trafficking of minors and died by jail cell suicide in August 2019 as he awaited trial, was known to have hosted numerous influential people at his private residence, including politicians, business leaders, and celebrities. 

However, while some names became public due to the flight logs of Epsteins Lolita Express private jet being made public, many arrived unnoticed.

A victim of Epstein has now implored Trump to reveal the names. People are very nervous and highly so. They'll be in a blind panic now, the now 37-year-old told The Mirror. Trumps pledge to expose these names should cause a lot of sleepless nights. Some of these men are incredibly powerful and have gone to great lengths to keep their associations with Jeffrey under wraps. If Trump gets back in, their days will be numbered. He should expose them. I know who I will be voting for.

Last night, leading US attorney Spencer Kuvin, who represents multiple women abused by Epstein, added: While this information would be interesting, I would also like to know how many times Epstein visited [Trumps] Mar-a-Lago. The lawyer was referring to how Epstein was known to have visited Trumps Florida mansion - once being filmed enjoying a party there with the property mogul.

Mar-A-Lago was also where Epstein and his convicted teen trafficker madam, Ghislaine Maxwell, recruited their sex slave Virginia Giuffre. She would later go on to allege she was loaned out to Prince Andrew to sleep with on several occasions by Epstein.
One of Ms Giuffres claims included accusing the Duke of York of taking part in an underage orgy on Little St James. Andrew has strenuously denied her claims against him and insisted he has no memory of even encountering his accuser.

Legal experts have cautioned that disclosing names without concrete evidence linking them to criminal behaviour could lead to significant legal challenges. If Trump releases a list of names, he could be opening himself up to serious risks, said one legal analyst.

Its not just a matter of public interest, its about the reputations and rights of individuals who may be implicated without due process. There is nothing to suggest any visitor knew of Epsteins offending or took any part in it.

That earnout is contingent on the benchmark being hit for 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period, beginning March 25,2024.

Tuesday is the 20th day and it is very unlikely that DJT will fall below the benchmark price of $17.50 per share by the end of that day.

The 36 million additional for Trump would be added to the 78.75 million shares he already owns, as the companys majority shareholder.
Total of 114.75 million shares.

When the earnout shares are added to his existing stock, Trumps total stake in Trump Media would be worth more than $4 billion on paper, at $35 a share.

The merged company, whose full name is Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Corp., began public trading under the DJT ticker on March 26,2024 at an opening price of $70.90 per share.

That price rose to a high of nearly $80 that day, briefly giving the company a market capitalization of more than $9 billion.

Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Corp. (DJT) is now $35.50 per share.

52 week high of $79.38
was on Tuesday,March 26,2024.
First day of trading under new name and stock symbol.

52 week low $12.40

The greatest show on Earth.

So lets look back a little to understand more.

Trump Media stock jumps as much as 50% after DJT ticker debut,
Tuesday,March 26,2024

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/03/26/trump-media-stock-ticker-djt-debuts-after-dwac-merger.html
 
This stock has had 4 major runs in 2024 lasting from 6 to 22 days.
Obviously,from all this recent activity,this stock is nowhere near finished for 2024.

Plan accordingly.
I wouldnt be surprised to see at least 3 more runs before November 2024.

Trump stock and options are nowhere near finished.Not with an additional 36 million more shares for Trump.Not with an election coming up.

"2024-09-17",1726550948,"Obese woman-child president of HOA I'm not a part of had a fatal heart attack while feuding with me ","Just to preface, yes this did take place in the USA. And no I won't say where. I'll include a TLDR as well. I live bordering a former HOA. It shut down about a year ago. My property is the closest one to them, but far enough away that it does not fall in their jurisdiction since I am not on their street. My property is next to their street, and my driveway enters from the main road. The HOA's road is more than a half mile of houses. Some really old, But the street was redeveloped in the 90s or so. And after that, an HOA was started. You go from a country road and then take a right turn, and bam, you're in semi-suburbia. There are large farms on each side of the former HOA road. The oldest houses were among those owned by the HOA board. And there is also an old small elementary school that was converted into a home by one of the board members. And that was also where the HOA had all their meetings.

When I moved into the area a couple of years ago, it was because I'd come into some money from inheritance, and decided to buy a semi-suburban small town property that had been vacant for several years after the previous house that was on it burned down. The land itself was cheap and heavily overgrown with brush. Once cleared out, I had a manufactured home put there. There was even an existing chain link fence with a gate that kept the property lines well divided. I had enough inheritance money to pay for about 50% of all this without effecting my prior savings. And the rest I had to take on a mortgage for. It's just the sort of property I wanted. A little place of my own where I can work remotely. And if I ever have to move, I can probably sell the place for roughly three times what I paid for it. But I hope to stay here as long as I can. I'm the type who likes to stay firmly planted somewhere. And I hate traveling.

I'd only been living in my current abode for a few days when I suddenly began getting trouble from the nearby HOA. The rotund HOA president showed up along with a couple of her board members on a trio of mobility scooters like they were some kinda biker gang. They had notepads in hand and creepy smiles that I can only describe as looking like they already won from the moment they'd arrived. I made the mistake of leaving my gate unlocked, and they just let themselves in. But they quickly learned I was not gonna let them force me into joining their little club. Before I could even tell them to get out, they'd already spread out. The president was giving me a pitch that the HOA was mandatory, and the other two people started telling me about all the bylaws I was supposedly in violation of. One of them being the state of my grass. Which was at the time almost non-existent because the ground had been leveled and re-seeded when my house was set up. I had none of their attitudes, and told them to leave. They refused and said they had a right to be there, and actually stated that my information from real estate that my property wasn't in their jurisdiction was wrong. I told them that was a stupid lie, and to get off my property. They refused to leave, so I had enough and went into my house, then came back out my old 22 rifle I've had since I was a kid, and threatened them with it. It's just a 22, but it's not a small rifle. So it looks intimidating enough

They lost their minds in panic at the sight of the rifle, and actually called the police on me instead of clearing out when I told them to. But the police sided with me after they arrived because the HOA board were all trespassing, and I was was fully within my rights to defend my own property. The stunned looks on their faces were gold when the police took my side, and told them to leave me alone since I was not in their HOA. The president whined about it repeatedly. But it did nothing because the cops also agreed I was not in the HOA's area of control, and they were overreaching their authority. Then they were all then forced to leave. Somehow they thought I'd be a pushover just because I look young. I was 36 at the time, and people still often mistake me for being mid 20s. I had a babyface growing up, and even tried growing a mustache for a while to look more mature. Didn't work out very well.

The HOA didn't quit trying to make me join. At first I was just getting membership applications in the mail. But then they started getting more passive aggressive. One of the board members even waited for me at my gate about a couple of weeks after the first incident just to tell me that my refusing to conform was ruining neighborhood moral. I reminded him I'm not in his neighborhood, and he told me he could have me shunned if I didn't join. I actually laughed at him for that. I bought a country property to be left alone. Go ahead and shun me. I've got my own friends in the nearby city if I want to see them. Then told the guy to stay away from my property. And if he ever trespassed again, I'd have him arrested. Right after that I started getting warnings in the mail for supposed infractions I'd committed. They actually sent me repeated warnings over the re-seeded grass. Did they not understand how newly planted grass grows? It takes a while to fill in. Then it stopped being warnings, and they sent me a long list of fines they expected me to pay. The fines were for me for having a gate, the gate being yellow, preventing mandatory inspection of my land and house, owning a firearm, having a car in the wrong color, my fence being old and rusty (It was already there when I bought the land), my fence being too tall (6 feet), my driveway not being paved (It's gravel), and they didn't consider my recently installed at the time metal shed an approved building. But that wasn't all. There were more fines going back years to the previous property owners, and the period my property sat vacant and overgrown. They actually expected me to pay in total they thirty thousand dollars.

I was especially livid after they had sent me that list of bogus fines, because they'd have had to have trespassed on my property just to know some of the things they were fining me for. Honestly I think they were just making up rules at some point to claim I'd broken them. I walked the neighborhood, and there were plenty of other rusty fences, patchy lawns, gravel driveways, cars the same color as mine, etc. I had to calm myself down with a drink, and then wrote a letter back stating I was not in the HOA, never will be, and would not pay anything to them. Especially not for anything from before I ever even owned the property. I also made it clear their attempts to fine me were blatantly illegal, if not outright fraud, and would not hold up in court. After that, my garbage can was vandalized after I put it out before going to work. It looked like it'd been cut up with an electric saw or something. I called the cops. But there was little they could do with no witnesses.

I had enough and paid a security company to come set up cameras. The HOA board took notice of the work vehicle from the security company as I saw the same two board members who previously harassed me sitting on scooters and watching from the end of my driveway. They clearly took my threat of retaliation seriously, because I got no more fake fines, and my trash can was never touched again. But they still kept sending me membership applications weekly, and even letters practically begging I just join to keep the peace. So I started mailing them back with ""NO!"" written in black sharpie on the envelopes. And even a letter threatening to wipe my ass with their applications before sending them back. And even that didn't make it stop. For a while I could not for the life of me figure out why they were so desperate to make me join. Turned out their elderly woman-child of an HOA president had practically become obsessed with some crazy plan she was calling HOA Zone Expansion. And was making it a hill to die on since the HOA could not legally expand beyond it's street without permission from surrounding property owners. And I highly doubt any of them would agree to join. I was just target #1 because I was the closest. And they wanted to make an example of me.

I just kept rebuffing the HOA's repeated attempts to contact me. Until one morning about three months after I'd moved in, I found my driveway blocked by a large transit van outside my gate. It was the HOA president, and she was blocking me in so she could personally make demands of me. I don't know why she bothered to use her van to block me in. She was already big as a whale, and could have just stood there herself. I even started calling her President Whale behind her back because she was morbidly obese to the My 600 Pound Life level, and often wore blue and white. She had on what I can best describe as a business jacket over a moo-moo dress, hair in a tight bun, big grandma glasses, and a beaded necklace with a big wooden cross hanging from her neck. And I'm not exaggerating when I say she usually had some kind of food in her hands. Like almost every time I saw her. Even during this interaction she stopped to eat. From what I learned of her later, she was a widow. And her husband was an obese person like her, that ate himself into his grave during his 50s. As for President whale. I do believe she had something very mentally wrong with her. But I wasn't sympathetic after what she tried to do to me.

Back to her van blocking me in. I told President Whale to move her damn vehicle, or I'd be calling the effing police on her. She scolded me like an old church lady for my choice of language, and said she didn't have to move because the HOA owns the road. And since I refused to join the HOA, or pay the fines, she was landlocking me in. Even I knew this was very illegal, and asked if she was mental, because I'm not even on the HOA's road. I'm on the main road the HOA road branches from. She refused to listen to me, so I started getting ready to call police. She tried to stop me from calling and claimed she just wanted to negotiate. I told her there was nothing to negotiate. She was blocking me in illegally, and I would be calling cops if she didn't move her van ASAP. But she pretended not to even hear me and said that if I just filled out the forms to join the HOA, all of my problems would go away. Then she went on a ""The HOA is so great!"" sales pitch, and refused to stop till I told her she was trying to act like a mafia boss, and the HOA was the source of all my problems she was claiming would go away. Then I said that all the junkfood she was eating was rotting her brain. She called me a petulant child. I reminded her I was a grown ass man, and she was a hypocrite to call me petulant when she was the one illegally blocking me in to try and blackmail me into joining her HOA.

She had the nerve to say what she was doing was morally right, and for the good of the community. I said back that it wasn't, it was just to satisfy her own ego, and blackmail is illegal. I also pointed out she wasn't being a good Christian by wearing a cross and claiming such lies. She rolled up the HOA forms and aimed to swat me with them. I had enough and finally called the police. Whale started screaming at me to hang up the call while attempting to chase me around and hit me. But the slow pile of blubber couldn't even get near me. After only a couple of attempts, she stopped and started wheezing. And then she started yelling to try and get the police on the phone to think I was attacking her. I called her out for this, and reminded her I have cameras. She immediately stopped and then waddled back to her van a tired sweaty mess. We stared each other down for around 20 minutes while she sat in the side of her van and stuffed her face before the cops showed up. They were initially unsure what was going on because of Whale's prior screaming when I called. But I had video from my dash-cam and my house to show I'd never laid a finger on her.

President Whale tried to make a big show of fake panic, and said I was dangerous. But the police told her to move her van as she was illegally blocking my driveway. She refused and said the road was the HOA's. But the cops said it wasn't the first time they'd been called because of her harassment in the area, and also stated that the road she was currently on, was not the HOA's road. And the road the HOA itself is on, is county owned, not private. Which was news to me. But it meant she couldn't do this, even if I was on the HOA's road. Then she was bluntly told she cannot block access to anyone, and to move the van right away, or be cited. She tried to argue further, so they ticketed her on the spot, and threatened to arrest her and have the van towed if she didn't comply. She gave us all death glares and finally moved the van. I arrived to work about an hour late that day. But with an interesting story to tell.

Not too long later I was served a small claims lawsuit from Whale. She was suing me for the cost of the fine she had to pay for the citation police gave her, and for emotional distress I caused that was affecting her health. I pretty much looked at the letter and laughed, because I was ready to pick that land whale apart in court. But then the HOA tried another dirty move around the same time. I was soon notified by my bank that someone was attempting to put a lien on my property for 30k. The same amount as what the HOA tried to previously fine me. I finally got a lawyer, and the lien was soon canceled because it was groundless. I filed counter lawsuits against Whale and the HOA for harassment. I also personally went to see the HOA board at their next meeting to tell them off for what they'd tried to do, and that I'd see them in court. Whale actually had one of those little wooden gavel mallets, and was repeatedly striking it on the table that she was sitting at. She pounded it on the table while yelling ""NOOOO!"" every time I tried to speak. The rest of the HOA board had to tell her to stop, and even took the gavel from her hand like she was a child that needed a time-out. She went on a tangent about how she was in charge. But the rest of the board told her to she needed to pack up and go home for the day. But she refused and just sat there with her arms crossed and pouting.

I talked with the rest of the board, and they tried to deny any involvement in the past things Whale had done to me. Including the attempted lien, which was only her doing apparently. I called those as outright lies, and pointed out how several of the board members had previously harassed me in person along with whale at my house, and they were also likely the ones who snuck onto my property to write more fines until I put cameras up. Because I certainly wouldn't figure Whale was the one climbing over my gate and trudging around like that with how fat she is. I then said I was suing them for the harassment, fake fines, and attempted lien on my property, and my destroyed trash can if I could prove it. I'd see them in court to take them for everything I could, because they were royally effed! Their faces all seemed to get flushed, save for Whale. She was puffy and red like a ripe tomato. I was then politely asked to leave so they could deliberate.

Not long after that, things came to an abrupt halt. Only a few days after I'd went to see the HOA board, President Whale was found dead in her home from a fatal heart attack. Apparently it had been brought on by stress and binge eating because the board had refused to stand by her, and voted to dismiss her as HOA president after I told them I was suing. I heard she had a full on child tantrum. I only wish I'd still been there to see it. Apparently she begged them to reconsider, and they packed her things for her and made her leave sobbing. She went home, and then died on her couch while binge eating cake. She lived alone, so nobody found her for days. And the morgue had a hell of a time getting her remains out of the house. She was in her mid sixties and morbidly obese with a serious junk food addiction. So she was basically one twinkie away from kicking the bucket at any time.

My lawsuit against the HOA ended when they agreed to settle out of court after Whale's death. They basically blamed everything on her. They claimed the fines and false lien were only her doing. Though I still don't really believe that. But the board wormed out of any serious consequences since it was Whale's name on all the paperwork. In the settlement the HOA paid all my legal fees, repaid the cost of my having to get CCTV cameras installed, and gave me a few thousand dollars on top of all that as a show of good faith. But Whale's family decided they were gonna come after both me and the HOA. They tried to sue both me and them for causing Whale's death. But the judge threw both cases out before they even went to court. I ended up getting a few anonymous threatening letters taped to my gate talking about things like breaking my legs. And the houses of each HOA board member got vandalized too. My mailbox was also ripped up out of the ground in the middle of the night. Joke was on them. I get all of my mail through a PO Box. Sadly I didn't have a camera at the end of the driveway to see who did it. I'd previously tried putting a trail cam there, but passing cars set it off all day and night. So I removed it.

The mailbox was only really there as an address marker anyway. And wasn't hard for me to replace. But tampering with a mailbox, even one that's basically just for display, is a federal offense. It couldn't be proven it was Whale's family that did it, as there were no cameras or witnesses that saw anything, and my mailbox was never found. But Whale's family vandalizing of the HOA board members' houses were all provable as there were cameras there, and those idiots didn't bother to cover their faces when they did all that damage. Some arrests were made, and a lot of restraining orders were filed. Whale's family finally sold her house and left. Guess they weren't stupid enough to go against a restraining order. I just replaced my display mailbox with one from Home Depot, and that's pretty much where the entire mess ends for me.

The whole situation was too much for the HOA though. And the residents passed a motion to shut it down completely. The HOA served no real function for comfort as there were no paid for common areas like a park or a pool. All meetings were held at the house of one of the board members, which as I said used to be a small school. There were accusations of repeated election rigging, as the board had remained the same for a long time, despite the fact they were so hated. And there were threats of an audit too. The board didn't fight the shut-down because they were all on the verge of being removed by force, so they were ready to throw in the towel. A couple of them even moved away. One of which I heard said that I had ruined everything, and the neighborhood was going to hell without the HOA. The former board were all retired busybodies anyway. The only one that's any semblance of liked, is the one who's house used to be a school and the HOA meeting building. They opened the gym room so locals could come in and play basketball on the regular. Their kids love it especially. I've been living peacefully here ever since, and I have actually made some friends. I didn't intend to. But I stopped to talk with neighbors a few times while out riding my bike, and it just went on from there. I've even been invited to a few barbecues and even a birthday party. Life is good.

TLDR: HOA harassed me for months to join. Obese woman-child president tried to fine me for anything she could think of, and even put a lien on my property. And she blocked my driveway by claiming she was landlocking me in. I sued the HOA, the HOA fired the president, the former president died from a heart attack caused by binge eating, then her family went on a revenge rampage, and then the HOA soon disbanded because they likely rigged elections and were threatened with an audit. Neighborhood is much better without the HOA.","fuckHOA",1311,"https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckHOA/comments/1fiqyz3/obese_womanchild_president_of_hoa_im_not_a_part/"

""Are you voting for trump this time or are you choosing hell?""","My mom is a 76 year old masters-degree educated black woman who is somehow, confoundingly, a huge trump supporter. She's been to multiple MAGA rallies, she has MAGA hats in an array of colors, she has donated thousands of her fixed income dollars to his campaign (Over $40K since 2015, at last count).

&lt;&lt;Why, you ask? Because she is a very conservative, fundamental Christian who goes to church 4-6 days a week and views abortion as the biggest crime of this era. She is against abortion for any reason. Even if the mother could die, even if the mother has other living children to take care of, even if the baby's daddy and grandpappy are the same guy.  She doesn't care how the fetus got in the womb, she says. She's had this belief system since the 80s - she was one of those people holding poster boards of aborted fetuses and yelling at patients in front of women's clinics. &gt;&gt;

My mom is a huge fan of Pat Robertson, Jim Bakker, Fred Price, all the big male televangelists from the 80s. She loves trump for the same reasons she loves them. Anyway on to the reason for the post.

We talk less and less during election years, the closer we get to November to avoid conflict. I'm her only child and she's a widow so I do check on her once a week, avoiding the politics topic like the plague that it is. But this week she decided to start the shit with me.

""It's almost time to vote! Are you voting for trump this time or are you choosing hell?""

I asked her some questions in response that pissed her off to the point of sputtering, but at least she got off my ass. I'll share them with you:

""What church is trump a member of, Mom? What church did he attend last Sunday? Or all summer? Or in all of 2024?""

""Trump cheated on all his wives. How many abortions do you think he's had to pay for, over the years, because he can't keep it in his pants?""

""How did you like Trump saying his administration will be 'great for women's reproductive rights"" on Truth Social the other day? How much of your hard-earned, anti-abortion life savings have you given him again..?""

**AITAH for telling my wife to take Trump out of the family prayer?** 

**Originally posted to** r/AITAH 

**TRIGGER WARNING:** &gt;!death of a parent, verbal abuse, racist undertones, losing a loved one to a cult!&lt; 

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/UImzf576it)  **March 9, 2024** 

(Let me start off by saying this is a throwaway account). 

Sounds a bit weird but let me explain. I (32M) am a politically neutral guy. My wife (25F) is not. She is pretty hardcore MAGA and has been since 2016 or whenever the last election was. She is pretty vocal on Facebook about her views and sometimes says some scary things (one time she asked my coworker to his face if he was documented, we literally grew up together in the Midwest lol). Anyway, I usually let it slide because its not hurting me, like I said I'm politically neutral.  
  
&amp;#x200B;

Last month though, she was getting my son (5M) to bed one night and after reading to him she did a prayer before bed. Normal stuff like, please pray for mommy, daddy, grandpa& and Trump. When I heard her say that I was confused why she was praying for just a guy who isnt in our family? I asked her about it really politely and she went off on me about how he is persecuted and needs prayers to win the election and fend off the enemy and whatever. Again, I let it go because I normally wouldnt care. But now she seems like she is doing this to spite me. Even during blessing before a meal she adds and bless Trump amen! really fast before I can argue. Last night was the worst one though. My dad (77M) had a small stroke and went to the hospital overnight. After I told her and my son, I did a small prayer for him. Of course before I said amen my wife added and bless Trump! Well this time I got mad. I told her she should keep him out of our family prayers and that this is our personal connection with God she is messing with by bringing in some weird old politician. Suffice it to say, she hasnt talked to me since. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I really in the wrong here? Maybe its not that big of a deal, but I feel like it's gone too far. AITAH? 

**TOP COMMENTS** 

**browzinbrowzin** 

&gt;Damn so you married a general asshole and now you're upset she's being an asshole to you specifically? 

&gt;NTA for asking your wife to not be petty when your father is in the hospital and you're feeling scared. But also you chose the bed you're lying in, you're just starting to realize politics impacts all eventually. 

**~** 

**nofilters1** 

&gt;""I let it slide because it's not hurting ME..."".  I can tell you that this political disconnect would be a deal breaker for me.  And she's about to create another Maga trumper right under your nose.  And you're okay with that?  F that. 

**~** 

**AltruisticCableCar** 

&gt;Honestly, your wife openly being racist by asking a coworker if he's documented and you not putting your foot down right there, does not sound like you're politically neutral. You allowed that behaviour and just let it slide. That's not good, mate. You're NTA for being upset with your wife bringing Trump into your prayer over family (wtf), but you need to have a long talk with her about her general behaviour and her comments, aside from just this latest issue. 

**~** 

**Cute-Profession9983** 

&gt;You're literally how the Nazis happened. ""It doesn't affect me, just everyone else, so I'm cool with it."" Your wife is either a gullible moron who went down the wrong internet rabbit hole or is a fascist. I know people like to throw that word around a lot, but that's because they don't know what it means. But what we're seeing in the states and in the world in general is a scary march towards authoritarianism that is anathema to the free world. I'd take my kid and run, but hey, it doesn't affect you right (like, she was racist to your boyhood friend's face)! 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/ume0mMYSvk)  **March 10, 2024 (Next Day)** 

This is an update from my post I made yesterday here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1barkq4/aitah\_for\_telling\_my\_wife\_to\_take\_trump\_out\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1barkq4/aitah_for_telling_my_wife_to_take_trump_out_of/) 

&amp;#x200B;

So I mentioned in my previous post that my dad suffered from a small stroke the night before. Well the small stroke was just the tip of the iceberg. Today my dad suffered a major stroke in the hospital and passed away last night. My whole family is devastated, including my wife. When I said a prayer over him she did not say anything about Trump and was very respectful.  
  
&amp;#x200B;

After we got home from the hospital was where I messed up. We were getting ready for bed and I thanked her. She asked for what, and I said for not bringing up Trump during the prayer for my dad. She immediately got mad at me about why I thought she was such a terrible person who would do something like that. I said she literally did it when we first found out he had a small stroke, and she said to me that it was before she knew it was that serious. I said that it was my dad, and of course it was serious to me. Then I really messed up and showed her the post I made yesterday to try to get her to understand. She read through all the comments and got even more mad at everything of course. Long story short she drove off to her friends house and left me having to deal with my son and without a car.  
 
&amp;#x200B;
 
Later she made this huge Facebook post about me and how Im a terrible person. She said I made her drop out of college when I met her as a freshman (in college) and forced her to start a family with me. (We met when we were 18 or older and the kid was her idea, but whatever.) I assume she got this idea from some of the comments about the age difference between us, so thanks. And then of course she says that I am against her and her beliefs and all the usual about Trump.   
  
&amp;#x200B;

I may update if something else happens but whatever. Thanks to some of you for actually trying to help. I could ignore calling me a troll but apparently Im a bad person for being politically neutral and basically a Nazi. I am not choosing a side on purpose to have less conflict because if you cant tell both sides are what cause the conflict.   

&amp;#x200B;
  
TLDR: My dad died and my wife drove off and won't talk to me, but who cares because apparently Im a troll/nazi/groomer or whatever. 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS** 

**noname_2024** 

&gt;Im not going to address the political donkey or the elephant in the room. What I am going to comment on is your wifes total lack of compassion and grace. Even if she had been justified in her anger and hurt, it was totally out of bounds to put you through that the night your father died. That is a heart issue way beyond politics. 

&gt;NTA 

**~** 

**Bd10528** 

&gt;Sorry about your dad. Beyond your wifes troubling views about a guy whos said he wants to be a dictator, her leaving you alone right after your father died is particularly troubling. NTA 

**~** 

**kymrlll** 

&gt;So your dad DIED and the next day she treats you like shit over TRUMP????? And left you stuck with a kid and no car?  You are NTA but her AHness issues have more issues than a newspaper 

**lamdarb** 

&gt;""both sides"" 

&gt;My dude, both sides are not the same. Your wife is a victim of a toxic cult-of-personality, and you and your family are victims as well. It's not healthy to worship an individual like she does, and inferring from your previous post, as Christians you should be very wary of such a person. 

&gt;Liberals, progressives, and regular ol' democrats aren't even the same thing, but none of them really adhere to the same level of cult worship as republicans do for Donald Trump. It's just not something you really see. 

&gt;I'm sorry that your wife has been programed, consider her dead, she's not the same. I lost my own father this way, everything is political. Even as evidence crushes the conspiracies he's sold, he's still 100% indoctrinated into the cult. He's gone. Your wife is gone.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmXlBoO7diw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmXlBoO7diw)

Please skip past the END UPDATE marker if you aren't looking for opinions from somebody who has been getting a lot of predictions correct, because I'm going to make a guess as to what will happen. This document drop is the first part of potentially several other damning reveals the Democrats have prepared, and based on election history it is very likely something worse like audio or video with something completely vile is going to be released. 

So everybody I'm sure remembers the ""grab 'em"" audio that the Dems thought would seal Trump's fate against Hillary while the DNC and Hillary pretended the audio just materialized without their knowledge? My guess is the Dems have had something worse than what already exists and on top of that they are willing for Bill Clinton and perhaps other big names to go down with Trump if that's what's at stake. The way major Congressional Dem leaders and Governors left the White House fully supporting Biden after a brief pep talk is highly suspicious. These are folks who need more confidence than a moving pep rally to get behind Biden 100%. So what would that be? They know something exists about Trump that is REALLY bad and either has been made public or will be made public. My money is something worse will be released as the current document released hasn't exactly shifted public opinion at all. Now the Democrats are using surrogates to force the media into talking about the newly released files which is a common Democrat play. Never have Team President push the media on these issues, but instead have surrogates push the narrative. I expect some more minor Dems to question the media about their rationale for evading coverage of this story. Crazy. Just crazy. 

**\[END UPDATE\]**

For anybody out of the loop, NEW documents were released in the 2016 Jane Doe v Epstein &amp; Donald Trump lawsuit. These are over 300 pages of never before seen documents with evidence confirming Donald Trump as a coconspirator with Jeffery Epstein in an underage sex trafficking scheme which include very graphic sexual language.

The problem? No major media outlet has covered this news since it went public on 7/1. The media that covers it does not provide any updated details, links, and some go as far as to falsely claim the documents released on 7/1 of this year are the same that were available in 2016. This is a misinformation campaign being supported by numerous outlets and fact checkers. Many of these sources range from right to center to left media.

The documents include details that confirm Epstein and Maxwell used their connection with Bill Clinton to force the media to drop the story in 2016. I'm bringing that up because if Trump was previously able to blackmail the media into dropping the story, Occam's Razor likely applies to why the story isn't being covered now. I'll point out that names like David Zaslav, billionaire owner of major media, has financial ties and possibly beyond (unconfirmed) with Epstein. Comedy Central is owned by Paramount, and I really don't know how they will respond. Associated Press have numerous articles published on this story, and every major media outlet uses Associated Press as their primary source.

I'd really hope to see Jon and TDS talk about not only this story, but also some focus on why the hell nobody in the media is covering this story and some are going as far as attempting to bury this story.

Here's the primary link to the main document.

**\[EDIT\]** I'm getting a lot of feedback regarding the 7/1 document drops concerning the limited media coverage of this. I can't go into debunking every single piece of misinformation. Again\*\*, the 7/1 drops are indeed from the 2016 case\*\* that had a partial reveal and the case was dismissed by the victim and the lawyer after death and bomb threats. Even thought the current **7/1 drops contain some of that information, all of the other things describing Trump's predatory actions against the victim are new** according to numerous credible sources. As for the mainstream media who have briefly covered the document drops, **many of those are using the misinformation campaign of never naming Trump in their coverage and focusing only on Epstein** despite long, graphic descriptions of Trump's sexual misconduct along with other evidence. I am including a photo of the documents which contain graphic sexual details which weren't made public until 7/1 which aren't being shown in the media. This page and document were not released in the 2016 document release.**\[EDIT\]**

I'm posting these links for the necessity of the people and TDS in a great time of need. Hopefully this will be enough evidence supporting that this is all new and also not being covered by any mainstream media. I have my own theories, but any investigation and theories is up to the fans and patriots and decent humans out there. Numerous other documents exist like evidence concerning phone calls between Epstein and Trump for ""massages."" Also the Grand Jury documentation exists and has been made public. I'm unable to currently find the link to that, but the documentation is beyond vile as it confirms the Grand Jury prosecution was allowed to verbally insult, harass and intimidate the victims of Epstein and Trump within the allowance of the court which goes beyond anything ethical and as far as I'm aware anything legal (I don't know if Florida allows it). There's plenty more in these over 300 documents, but hopefully I've covered the major things.

Why the media is evading and attempting to bury this news... that's something likely of major concern. I'm of the theory the news is owned by a select few billionaires who Trump has dirt on that would end them, and they are afraid Trump will squeal if they put this on the news. Please feel free to disagree and speculate.

This move is aimed at financing the ambitious plans she has outlined for her presidency. Harris's campaign spokesperson, James Singer, emphasized that this tax hike is a ""fiscally responsible"" measure to ensure that billionaires and large corporations contribute their fair share, ultimately benefiting working people.

The proposed 28% corporate tax rate would undo a significant portion of former President Donald Trumps 2017 tax reform, which lowered the rate from 35% to 21%. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that each percentage point increase in the corporate tax rate could generate around $100 billion over a decade. While Harris's new proposal aligns with President Joe Bidens recent budget, it represents a shift from her 2020 campaign stance, where she advocated for a full repeal of Trumps tax cuts. Republicans are expected to push back against the proposed increase, setting the stage for a major debate in Congress, especially as many of Trump's tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025.

If you haven't already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.
Recently I was made aware that Al of 'me' falsely endorsing Donald Trump's presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around Al, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.
I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman's right to her own body for decades.
I've done my research, and l've made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters:
Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it's much easier to vote early. I'll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.

He really believes because he has broad support in the MAGA movement he can mouth any absurdity, that they will believe any craziness, and he can motivate them to treasonous violence with his exaggerations -- fanatical drooling exhortations, -- and in his derangement call for the death of any imagined political opponent and a maddened horde will rise to support him.

We all have different political beliefs, some even at odds with other firmly held beliefs, but will we murder each other in furtherance of those ideals?

Folks, please sit back and take an unbiased look at this tyrant; take a minute to truly observe him. The signs are all there in his words and especially in his demeanor -- he is a sick man.

Disagree with each other if you must, but do you hate America? Is this fascist form of government the one you really want -- will this be 1937 all over again?

Donald Trump is on the warpath. Following his historic felony conviction on hush-money and election interference charges, the ex-president has rapidly escalated his threats of *violence and mayhem,* along with other *forms of cult-leader and dictator rhetoric*, in service to his plan for *revenge and retribution* against those he believes have impeded his ascent to universal worship and glory. 

Reality, of course, is simpler: Donald Trump was convicted by a *jury of citizens,* based on the overwhelming preponderance of the evidence*. There is no conspiracy or witch hunt* *against him.* He is, at best, finally being held somewhat responsible for his decades of *obvious criminal conduct.* 

Trumps escalations, as I have repeatedly warned, offer an example of how the personal is political for someone like him, meaning aspiring autocrats and authoritarians. Donald Trump has already *promised to be a dictator on Day One* of his regime if he defeats Joe Biden in November. Trump and his agents *threats of violence* (and not-infrequent acts of violence) serve their authoritarian political project. Trump's personality, emotional life and thinking are centered upon *violence and other antisocial behavior.* His new status as a *convicted criminal* and the prospect, however unlikely, that he may actually go to prison have created a form of synergy between the personal and political that is potentially, if not likely explosive as seen on Jan. 6.  

Trumps recent fundraising emails, alongside his campaign speeches and media interviews, offer a public chronicle of hi*s escalating threats of violence, destruction and revenge.* Consider this excerpt from an email I received:

BIDENS SOVIET TACTICS DONT SCARE ME!

Id go to jail AGAIN AND AGAIN if thats what it took to Save America.

Because this fight has always been bigger than me, Friend.

Its about restoring power where it belongs  TO YOU THE PEOPLE  and ending the tyrannical Biden regimes reign of terror once and for all.

In this one, the language is even more explicit: 

THEY *OPENED FIRE* ON MAGA!

NOBODY is safe from the *RADICAL LEFT WAR MACHINE.*

I warned you this would happen after my rigged conviction.

This one contains an implicit but barely concealed threat against President Biden, along with the absurd claim that Biden tried to have Trump killed, presented as an incitement that may require a response: 

BIDEN'S DAY OF RECKONING IS COMING

He tried to publicly torture and humiliate me ... BUT HE FAILED.

He tried to raid my home and *take me out with deadly force.*.. BUT HE FAILED.

*He tried to bury me* with so many witch hunts that I'd be forced to quit... BUT HE FAILED.

STAND WITH TRUMP

34 RIGGED FELONY CONVICTIONS calls for an unprecedented response.

And if our response to his tyrannical regime isn't MASSIVE, Biden will move onto his next target: YOU!

In what is perhaps the most ominous and dangerous of these, Trump literally told his followers in a Thursday email that *he might face the death sentence*. (Before walking it back just enough, in classic Trump fashion.) The point of the metaphor is clear enough: Trump and his followers face existential danger, and those who remain loyal must be prepared to defend their leader at any cost:

*THEY WANT TO SENTENCE ME TO DEATH!*

You know theyd do it if they could, but Crooked Joes team of lowlifes and radical left thugs will settle for a *LIFE SENTENCE. ...*

Remember, its not me theyre after&

THEYRE AFTER YOU - IM JUST STANDING IN THEIR WAY!

But with your support,

Ill NEVER give up.

ILL NEVER SURRENDER! ...

Your support is the only thing standing between the Biden regime and their ultimate goal of DESTROYING AMERICA ONCE AND FOR ALL.

*I hardly need to state that all of this is a bald-faced lie. Trump's criminal convictions do not carry a potential death sentence  or a potential life sentence either.* The prosecutors, judges and *law enforcement officers involved in Trumps felony trial were not obeying Joe* *Bidens commands.* Whatever one may think of Biden, he's a stickler for the rules of representative democracy, and believes in an independent judiciary.

Despite the mainstream news medias dedicated efforts attempts to normalize Trump's propaganda escalations  in this case by largely ignoring them  none of this is normal, at least not in a healthy democracy. Trumps communications with his most faithful followers should not be seen as bluster or hyperbole. They amount to a coordinated effort to radicalize the most volatile and delusional elements of the MAGA base  and then, perhaps, to mobilize them. Toward what end, exactly? We already have a pretty good idea.

2) He wrote an entire book about the Appalachian region that stereotyped us all as lazy, helpless, drug addicted and violent people. He didnt write a memoir about his experience visiting his grandmother, he wrote a book that reflected on the Appalachian experience as a whole. Academics and the media have ran with this farce as the true Appalachian experience. Real Appalachians wouldnt write this kind of book about their own people.

We dont claim you JD Vance, so stop claiming us. We deserve politicians who actually care about our region and our problems, not ones who cosplay as one of us so they can write a book to advance their political career.

&gt; Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you havent already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.   
&gt; 
&gt; Recently I was made aware that Al of me falsely endorsing Donald Trumps presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around Al, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.   
&gt; 
&gt; I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. Im voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a womans right to her own body for decades.  
&gt; 
&gt; Ive done my research, and lve made my choice.
&gt; Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find its much easier to vote early. Ill link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.

He lies to your face, and you blithely accept it, not because you know it to be true, but because you want it to be true; really, how smart is that? he leads you by the nose of you prejudices, manufactures fear in you, and chuckles with his aides as he does it.

For instance, do you really believe there are some states where you are allowed to kill a child after birth? Are you gullible enough to believe that.He said that Biden claimed he flew fighter planes. There is no evidence of this happening, but it make good fodder for those who want to believe.

For some absurd reason he said the news is not reporting on the war in Ukraine, anymore. Stupid! Just turn on your TV,.

In a ridiculous dig at Biden, he said that he, Trump, filled up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The opposite is true, there was less in it when he left off ice than was init we he  started in office. I guess he figures you are too dumb to check so he;d slide this on by you.

He rails against the national debt but forget to inform you it went up 25% under his administration mostly because of tax cuts for those already obscenely wealthy.

He claimed the price of bacon went up five times under Biden It did not. it did rise to6.50 a pound form 5,80 a pound (a 115 increase) not the 400 % he was claiming. But what the hell, you'll believe anything.

He said when Biden pulled out of Afghanistan, he left 85 billion dollars' worth of arms behind. Another gross exaggeration to keep your hair on fire. While 7 billion dollars worth was left behind, much of it was rendered inoperable before we left. He didn't tell you that, did he?

He claimed Nancy Pelosi was responsible for the insurrection on 1/6. Not even remotely true! Pelosi was not responsible for security that day, that is the responsibility of the Capitol Police Board. He said he offered 10,000 national guard members in advance of 1/6 but there is no evidence of that. But Trump knows you'll believe it because you want to believe.

And the biggest lie of all. he says the election was stolen, but can't produce an iota of evidence that will be accepted in any court in the country.

That's it. I'm tired of typing. But if you want to know what jackasses you've been by being manipulated by him, all you have to do is Google 'Trump lie's'. Be prepared for a long. ,long read.

Check this out:

""Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally, Saturday, June 22, 2024, at Temple University in Philadelphia. Trump was mocked on social media after video showed whole sections of the 10,000 capacity stadium were empty.

Donald Trump has been mocked on social media after footage from his rally at Temple University's Liacouras Center, a 10,000-seat venue, showed large numbers of open seats and entire sections of the upper level completely empty.

In May, a similar controversy arose over the attendance at a rally Trump held in South Bronx, New York. His spokesperson told Newsweek that 25,000 people attended the rally, though a number of journalists independently denied the figure.

Trump, who became the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential candidate in March, has been holding high-profile rallies across the nation in a bid to strengthen support before November's likely rematch against President Joe Biden. Pennsylvania is a crucial swing state, which Biden won in 2020 after it backed Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Chris Jackson, a Democratic Party activist, posted a 27-second clip on X, formerly Twitter, of Trump at the Philadelphia rally on Saturday, in which the venue's upper tiers of seating appeared empty.

Jackson wrote: ""Look at all those empty seats in Philadelphia. Old man can't even fill a high school gym fill anymore. Sad.""

At the time of writing, Jackson's post had received 1,200 reposts and 970,000 views on the platform.

Peter Henlein, a self-styled ""political junkie,"" posted the same clip, writing: ""Here is a video of Trump at his rally tonight in swing state PA at Temple University's Liacouras Center, capacity 10,200. It's half empty. Zero attendees in the upper bowl.

""Odd for a guy that brags about pulling 100k ppl in NJ and 30k in the Bronx.""

Another user posted a video of the venue that was recorded before the rally began.

""They got the entire back of the arena covered up with flags,"" the user wrote. ""The capacity at the Philly Trump rally is 10,206 and they're not getting anywhere near that.""

Newsweek contacted representatives of Trump's 2024 presidential campaign for comment via email outside usual business hours.

During his speech, Trump focused heavily on crime, saying: ""Few communities have suffered more under the Biden regime than Philadelphia. Under Crooked Joe, the City of Brotherly Love is being ravaged by bloodshed and crime.""

""Retail theft in Philly is up 135 percent since I left office. The convenience stores are closing down left and right. The pharmacies have to lock up the soap,"" he continued, adding, ""You can't buy toothpaste. You can't buy a toothbrush. It takes you 45 minutes.""

Data released by the FBI earlier this month showed a 15 percent fall in violent crime between January and March, compared to the same period last year. This included a 26.4 percent fall in murders, 25.7 percent decrease in rapes and 12.5 percent decline in aggravated assault.

On June 27, Trump and Biden are set to meet in Atlanta for the first of two scheduled debates ahead of the general election on November 5. NBC News' Jake Traylor said on Saturday that Trump told reporters he had decided on a running mate. Trump reportedly said his vice presidential choice would ""most likely"" be at Thursday's debate.""

Minneapolis Star-Tribune, July 29, 2024  2:13pm 

By Jennifer Brooks

Stung by Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's suggestion that the Grand Old Party is full of ""weird people"" these days, Republicans set out to prove they're not weird in the weirdest possible ways.

Donald Trump Jr., son of the former president/convicted felon, fired back with a video clip of Vice President Kamala Harris having a nice chat with a drag queen. The only one who came out looking less than fierce and fabulous in that post was Junior himself.

If you were one of the weird kids who got bullied on the playground, you might grow up to wear weird as a badge of honor. But weird hits differently if you were one of the bullies. Weird was their word for the weak. That might be why a party that shrugged off racism, sexism, school shootings, Nazi tiki torch parades, an attempted coup and a 78-year-old presidential candidate with 34 felony convictions absolutely melted down when Walz called them weird.

""This whole 'they're weird' argument from the Democrats is dumb &amp; juvenile,"" sputtered onetime Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, continuing the party's ""I am rubber, you made eye contact with a drag queen"" defense.

In the words of activist and school shooting survivor David Hogg  who has recently promoted Walz as a VP pick  ""if you gotta say you aren't weird- I got bad news for ya.""

By the weekend, you couldn't turn on a Sunday talk show without finding a Democrat pointing to some weird thing happening over in the Trump campaign.

Walz, now on the vice presidential shortlist, was in the thick of it. When, he wondered, was the last time America heard Trump laugh? If Trump has ever laughed, Walz said, it was probably at someone, not with them.

""Listen to the guy,"" he told CNN on Sunday. ""He's talking about Hannibal Lecter and shocking sharks and just whatever crazy thing pops into his mind.""

Former President Donald Trump cannot stop singing the praises of fictional and criminally insane cannibal Hannibal Lecter. The man took a detour in the middle of his own nomination acceptance speech to eulogize the ""late, great Hannibal Lecter"" to an approving crowd at the Republican National Convention. When he's not talking about cannibals or sharks or winning elections that he resoundingly lost, Trump's weirdness takes an uglier turn.

For years, Trump has rhapsodized about iron-fisted dictators overseas. Last week, at the Turning Point Believers Summit in Florida, he suggested that the 2024 election might be the last one America ever needs if he wins. No more voting necessary.

""You won't have to do it anymore,"" Trump promised. ""It'll be fixed. It'll be fine. You won't have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.""

National weirdness begets state-level weirdness. For years, one of the biggest draws at the Minnesota Republican Party's State Fair booth has been a cut-out of Hillary Clinton in prison stripes. The party's endorsed candidate for the U.S. Senate is extremely online reply guy Royce White, who spent campaign funds at strip clubs and begins and ends most online interactions with some variation of ""shut up"" followed by an expletive. The ""only conservative"" running for the Hennepin County Board allegedly threw a tarantula at a woman to settle an argument and posted selfies after her weekend in jail.

**Heres what the New York billionaire thinks of Georgia in his own words:**

&gt;**RAFENSBERGER'S STAFF:** Weve been going through each of those \[ballots alleged to be cast by non-Georgian residents\] as well and those numbers that we got that Ms. Mitchell was just saying, theyre not accurate. *Every one weve been through, are people that lived in Georgia, moved to a different state, but then moved back to Georgia legitimately.* And in many cases

&gt;**TRUMP:** How many people do that? ***They moved out and then they said, Ah, to hell with it Ill move back.*** You know, it doesnt sound like a very normal & ***you mean, they moved out, and what, they missed it so much that they wanted to move back in? Its crazy.***

**Heres what he thinks of the GBI and our Justice System:**

&gt;""Theyre either ***dishonest*** ***or*** ***incompetent***.""

**Heres what he thinks of our Secretary of State and our Justice System:**

&gt;**RAFENSBERGER'S:** Mr. President, you have people that submit information and we have our people that submit information. And then it comes before the court and the court then has to make a determination. We have to stand by our numbers. We believe our numbers are right.

&gt;**TRUMP:** Why do you say that? I dont know. I mean, **s*****ure, we can play this game with the courts, but why do you say that?*** \[...\] Why wouldnt you want to say, hey, if in fact, President Trump is right about that, then he wins the state of Georgia, just that one incident alone without going through hundreds of thousands of dropped ballots. You just say, *you stick by*, I mean ***Ive been watching you, you know, you dont care about anything***.Your numbers are right. But your numbers arent right. Theyre really wrong and theyre really wrong, Brad. And I know this phone call is going nowhere other than, other than ultimately, you know  ***Look ultimately, I win, okay?***

**Heres what he thinks of our Governor:**

&gt;""I endorsed him and he got elected, but I will tell you, ***he is a disaster***.

&gt;If I didnt run, \[Brian Kemp\] wouldnt have had even a shot, either in the general or in the primary. ***He was dead, dead as a doornail***. He never thought he had a shot at either one of them. What a schmuck I was.

For the Georgians that forgot or just didnt know, Trump despises you and despises Georgia. He thinks this place is so beneath him that he cant even imagine someone wanting to live here. He looks down on our cities and your state government. He sneers at our law enforcement and justice system. He does not want your vote to be counted if you cast a ballot for anyone but him.

But, what I was most struck by was the fact that Kamala and Tim were both capable of actually giving a speech *while* interacting with the crowd. It was such a relief. Of course, everyone has seen Tim Walz stopping in the middle of his speech to acknowledge the person needing assistance. But, there were a few off-the-cuff moments for Kamala as well. For example, she stopped mid speech to respond to a person in the crowd with ""We will let the courts deal with that, our job is to hold Trump accountable at the ballot box"" (or something like that) It was such a breath of fresh air. Competent and coherent intelligent people addressing a crowd. It was like taking a time machine to when candidates from both parties were actually promoting and explaining policy instead of spouting bumper sticker slogans. Previously, I was anybody but Trump. Now, I'm fully on board with Kamala/Walz. This isn't a Band-Aid. It's the real deal.

","Im almost 40 and vowed to stay out of all politics through my entire life but after seeing it daily for 15 years in the military and growing up in backwoods Florida, Im done ignoring it. I raised by religious republicans who ingrain every part of their lives with their political affiliation. I pass half a dozen MAGA stickers driving anywhere through town. The mean old man across the street has a the family in this house loves god, guns, and Trump flag (he is single). My grandpa even built a shed and etched something like this isnt Obamas, its mine in the slab. I avoid social media and this is the even first thing Ive ever felt the need to post on here. 

Ive always ignored it and just told myself my vote really doesnt count anyways, until 2 weeks ago when I finally registered to vote and I plan to vote for Harris. I dont care if my vote does nothing to sway the election. Im just tired of all the hate created by the Right. Do I think either side cares about me? Not really. I just want to know I did my part to cancel a Trump vote and attempt to end this hate that seems to be growing. Its not healthy and I dont want my kids to inherit this mess. Hopefully others feel the same way and finally vote as well.

""In April 2023, Lindell was ordered by an arbitration panel to pay $5 million to a computer forensics expert who debunked his data about the 2020 presidential election. The panel's decision stemmed from a 2021 symposium in which Lindell claimed he possessed data that proved Chinese interference affected the results of the 2020 election. He also offered $5 million to anyone who could prove his data did not correspond to the election.

Computer forensics expert Robert Zeidman, 63, ended up proving Lindell wrong, according to a private arbitration panel. The panel ruled that Zeidman, who The Washington Post said was a Trump voter from Nevada, had successfully examined Lindell's data and found it did not prove that voter fraud occurred in the election. As a result, the panel said, Lindell Management, which created the contest, must give Zeidman $5 million after initially refusing to pay him.

In a 12-page order released on Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge John Tunheim upheld the $5 million ruling against Lindell, in which he must pay Zeidman.""","OhNoConsequences",180,"https://www.reddit.com/r/OhNoConsequences/comments/1b9ycgg/mike_lindell_ordered_by_judge_to_pay_the_promised/"

Manchin's decision is sad but not surprising. He's a coward. I support nuking the filibuster so that the Senate can codify Roe v. Wade (unfortunately, however, the Republicans are probably gonna take control of the Senate in November, which would make that a moot point).

This presidential election is highly important. If Donald Trump wins, then Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito might retire, allowing Trump to replace them with younger Republican Justices, allowing the Republicans to continue to control the Supreme Court for much longer. So I really hope that Harris wins.","atheism",166,"https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1foq9kw/sen_joe_manchin_iwv_wont_endorse_kamala_harris/"

She passed a few years ago from aggressive brain cancer at 65 and among years of other things, when she got sick this man would not take her to appointments because he didnt like to drive on the highway. And put all her care needs onto my father who was trying to keep his business afloat during COVID. 


Anyways, wake is wrapping up and Im stuck.
