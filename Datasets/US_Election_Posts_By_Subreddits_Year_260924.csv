"2023-12-22",1703287049,"Thomas Dewey and Hillary Clinton made the same fatal campaign mistakes","Thomas Dewey and Hillary Clinton have much in common. They were both ahead in the polls and were confident they would trounce their opponents in the election. The media, for all intents and purposes, asserted in 1948 and 2016 that they would easily defeat their opponents. Dewey halfheartedly campaigned for the presidency and just assumed he would win, while President Truman made whistle stop campaigns across the country, giving impassioned speeches and pointing out his administrations successes. Hillary Clinton made the mistake of not campaigning where it mattered and not even visiting the Rust Belt states, while Trump (whether you love or hate him) traversed the battleground states, as well as blue states. 

In 1948, newspapers with the headline Dewey Defeats Truman began being circulated preemptively. In 2016, Newsweek commemorative editions titled Madame President made it to some shelves before being recalled. The point here is to illustrate that given better campaign strategies, a different result could have happened in each case. While Clinton won the popular vote over Trump, a colossal error was made on her part by not bolstering support in the swing states and assuming that she was just running against a buffoon who she had 90-10 betting odds of defeating.","Presidents",3045,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidents/comments/18orqan/thomas_dewey_and_hillary_clinton_made_the_same/"

"2023-10-04",1696419935,"CMV: Most Biden Supporters aren't voting for Biden because they like him or his policies, they just hate Trump and the GOP","Reuploaded because I made an error in the original post

As Joe Biden and Donald Trump are signifcant favourites to lead both their respective parties into the 2024 election. So I think it's fair to say that the 2024 US election will be contested between these 2 candidates. I know Trump is going through some legal issues, but knowing rich, white billionaires, he'll probably be ok to run in 2024
  

  
Reading online forums and news posts has led me to believe that a signifcant portion of those who voted for Biden in 2020, and will vote for him again 2024 aren't doing so because they like him and his policies, but rather, they are doing so because they do not support Donald Trump, or any GOP nomination.
  

  
I have a couple of reasons for believing this. Of course as it is the nature of the sub. I am open to having these reasons challenged
  

  
\-Nearly every time voting for Third Parties is mentioned on subs like r/politics, you see several comments along the lines of ""Voting Third Party will only ensure Trump wins."" This seems to be a prevailing opinion among many Democrats, and Biden supporters. I believe that this mentality is what spurs many left wingers and centrists who do NOT support Biden into voting for him. As they are convincted that voting for their preferred option could bolster Trump
  

  
\-A Pew Research poll (link: https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/election-2020-voters-are-highly-engaged-but-nearly-half-expect-to-have-difficulties-voting/?utm\_content=buffer52a93&amp;utm\_medium=social&amp;utm\_source=twitter.com&amp;utm\_campaign=buffer ) suggets up to 56% of Biden voters are simply voting for him because they don't want Trump in office. It's possible to suggest this is a mood felt among a similar portion of Biden voters, but then again, the poll only had \~2,000 responses. Regardless, I seem to get the feeling that a lot of Biden's supporters are almost voting out of spite for Trump and the GOP.
  

  
Here's a CBC article on the same topic (https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-joe-biden-u-s-election-loathing-love-1.5798122)
  

  
\-Biden's opinion polls have been poor, very poor. With some sources putting his approval rating as low as 33%, I find it hard to believe therefore that he'll receive votes from tens of millions of Americans because they all love him. Are opinion polls entirely reliable? No. But do they provide a President with a general idea of what the public thinks of then? In my opinion, yes. How can a President gain 270 electoral votes and the majority of the population's support when he struggles to gain 40%+ in approval ratings. For me, this is a clear sign of many people just choosing him not because they like Biden, but because they just don't want the GOP alternative.
  

  
Am I wrong? Or just misinformed? I'm open to hearing different opinions.","changemyview",2211,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16zl0f3/cmv_most_biden_supporters_arent_voting_for_biden/"

"2023-11-27",1701106663,"CMV: Not voting for Biden in 2024 as a left leaning person is bad political calculus","Biden's handling of the recent Israeli-Palestinian conflicts has encouraged many left-leaning people to affirm that they won't be voting for him in the general election in 2024. Assuming this is not merely a threat and in fact a course of action they plan to take, this seems like bad political calculus. In my mind, this is starkly against the interests of any left of center person. In a FPTP system, the two largest parties are the only viable candidates. It behooves anyone interested in either making positive change and/or preventing greater harm to vote for the candidate who is more aligned with their policy interests, lest they cede that opportunity to influence the outcome of the election positively.

Federal policy, namely in regards for foreign affairs, is directly shaped by the executive, of which this vote will be highly consequential. There's strong reason to believe Trump would be far less sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than Biden, ergo if this is an issue you're passionate about, Biden stands to better represent your interest.

To change my view, I would need some competing understanding of electoral politics or the candidates that could produce a calculus to how not voting for Biden could lead to a preferable outcome from a left leaning perspective. To clarify, I am talking about the general election and not a primary. Frankly you can go ham in the primary, godspeed.

To assist, while I wouldn't dismiss anything outright, the following points are ones I would have a really hard time buying into:

- Accelerationism
- Both parties are the same or insufficiently different
- Third parties are viable in the general election

EDIT: To clarify, I have no issue with people threatening to not vote, as I think there is political calculus there. What I take issue with is the act of not voting itself, which is what I assume many people will happily follow through on. I want to understand their calculus at that juncture, not the threat beforehand.","changemyview",2136,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1858lk8/cmv_not_voting_for_biden_in_2024_as_a_left/"

"2024-02-12",1707748187,"CMV: If Trump wins this year, we can blame Biden for not stepping down and allowing someone else to lead the Party and run for election","When Biden was voted in in 2020, there was a belief amongst the Democratic Party voter base that he was only running against Trump and he would pass the torch to younger politicians during his presidency. It's unclear how widespread this belief was but I'm pretty confident that it is pretty popular amongst the young and progressive wing of the party. But Biden did not step down and let someone else take the helm. The Democratic Party also did not actively search for a replacement after he was sworn in. Now we might pay the price for this shortsightedness. If betting odds are an indicator, Trump's odds of winning is growing week by week. Republicans are attacking Biden for being too old and too senile. While that is obviously hypocritical given Trump's age and mental capacity, I feel like it is effective at discouraging younger voters from voting for either party, giving Trump a very good chance at winning the whole thing.

Had Biden stepped down and given more opportunities for other Democratic candidates to shine, I think we won't be in such a dire situation.

To be clear, we can blame a bunch of factors for Trump winning, like Republicans voting for this mess of a guy, but I think putting some of the blame on Biden is a valid thing to do.","changemyview",2068,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ap19ue/cmv_if_trump_wins_this_year_we_can_blame_biden/"

By convincing many young Americans that there is basically no difference between the two parties, they create lots of voter apathy which convinces young people and other leftists to stay home. This is essentially what got Trump elected (and appointing three Supreme Court justices) the first time around, and as a left wing person that agrees with these people on nearly every policy point, I am concerned that its going to happen again, and I am more concerned that so many alleged leftists seem to be okay with this.

Formally, sentences would have been far harsher, mainly because there would be no 50/50 partisan split in terms of moral condemnation; rather, the condemnation would be universal which would embolden prosecutors and judges to impose stricter sentences.

Informally, associates and families of the insurrectionists would be far more stigmatized for similar reasons. As for those at the vanguard of the insurrection, many of these individuals would not survive to face charges, because US law enforcement tends to take a far heavier hand towards left-wing political extremism than right-wing political extremism.

EDIT: A LOT of people on here citing the 2020 BLM protests. But this does not CMV, because the 2020 BLM protests have nothing to do with my hypothetical, which deals with J6. Also, the 2020 BLM movement consisted of mostly peaceful protests, rather than a targeted attack on our self-governance in which organs of government including the President were directly involved or at least complicit. Also, the manner in which the police engaged the 2020 BLM protests with, in many cases, an eye towards suppressing the movement, tends to support my view, rather than changing it. The claim is frequently made that violent BLM protesters were ""let off,"" but without evidence.

* If you want to say that ""only"" 20,000 died, suggesting a low death to bomb ratio, fine, but bombing campaigns are aimed at *infrastructure*, so as long as the kind of infrastructure attacked is indiscriminate, the campaign is indiscriminate.

* If you want to say Hamas hides themselves in civilians, I'm referring to infrastructure used by militants _or not_. Unless you believe that nearly all buildings in Gaza City are used by militants, then it's indiscriminate.

* Don't bring up genocide or indiscriminate _killing_. I'm not accusing Israel of these in this post, so I won't entertain that rebuttal.

* Warning inhabitants is irrelevant, because civilians and militants receive the same warning, so there's no discrimination between both groups prior to bombing.

To close this out, here are some quotes from Israeli officials:

&gt; There is one and only (one) solution, which is to completely destroy Gaza before invading it. I mean destruction like what happened in Dresden and Hiroshima, without nuclear weapons, Moshe Feiglin, the founder of Israel's right-wing Zehut Party and former Likud representative in Israels parliament 
 
&gt; Gaza should be razed and Israels rule should be restored to the place."" Moshe Feiglin, the founder of Israel's right-wing Zehut Party and former Likud representative in Israels parliament  

&gt;  The emphasis is on damage, not accuracy, declared the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).  

&gt; Gaza will eventually turn into a city of tents, said one IDF official, adding, There will be no buildings.  

&gt; Israels economy minister, Nir Barkat, told ABC News that hostages and civilian casualties will be secondary to destroying Hamas, even if takes a year.  

&gt; Israels former chief military advocate general and the countrys former attorney general no less, who declared that to destroy Hamas then you have to destroy Gaza, because everything in Gaza, almost every building there, is a stronghold of Hamas.  

And of course Joe Biden's Theyre starting to lose that support by indiscriminate bombing that takes place,


If you can show that MOST of these civilian buildings, key word MOST, are used for military purposes, and the military objective justifies the destruction we see, then you've changed my view

Edit: A delta has been given because I didn't consider intent. I'm conceding that intent needs to be a factor in charging a war crime. I think the method of execution and the end result fit the bill, but to prove intent is more difficult and it's something I didn't consider. To use a hostage example, if a police officer uses excessive force or has a complete disregard for the hostage's life, and if the officer ends up killing both the hostage and hostage taker, they can be charged with murder depending on the circumstances even if the officer has no intent to kill the hostage.","changemyview",1403,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18nlkbs/cmv_israels_bombing_campaign_is_indiscriminate/"

This state is the wealthiest in the nation and holds a remarkable economic standing, with a GDP that, if considered independently, would rank among the top 10 globally.

On top of that, the GOP has this habit of throwing around racist remarks, which just doesn't sit right with Asians. It's the kind of stuff that could be used against them, especially when we're talking about the surge in hate crimes against Asians.

While Asians encompass a rich tapestry of ethnic diversity, I want zero in on the ""holy Asian trinity"" (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) due to their numerous and influential representation among the Asian community. 

Education holds immense significance in Asian culture, exemplified by phenomena like cram schools in East Asian countries such as Korea and Japan, where students attend supplementary classes to gain a competitive edge in entrance exams to some of the most competitive colleges in their respective country.

Drawing a comparison within the U.S., [states under Republican governance tend to exhibit lower academic achievements than their Democratic counterparts.](https://time.com/101697/blue-states-barack-obama-won-in-2012-are-more-educated-than-red-states/) This discrepancy is often attributed to the Republican Party's inclination to reduce funding for education, resulting in lower academic outcomes.

While there is a consensus that schools could benefit from increased cost efficiency, the solution does not lie in defunding education. Democrats tend to lean towards supporting social safety nets and regulations, and this tends to resonate more with educated minorities.

"2023-11-29",1701263573,"CMV: a Trump 2024 presidency would irreversibly alter United States politics &amp; partisanship as we know it","Loaded post, I know and this is a bit heady, but please let me explain. Im from the Midwest and Trump supporters are everywhere. They frequently claim that Trump is being hit with political legal attacks during these court cases. They claim this like theyre saying something outrageous. They also act like Trump wouldnt do the exact same thing against his opponents, or worse if re-elected. 

First off, obviously the cases against trump are completely political. Hes the former president, and I dont see any republican plaintiffs. However, when I mention politics, Im looking past the superficial ideological divide and Im analyzing the actual mechanics and science behind power and mass influence. The study of politics is just that, the discipline studying the application of power and exercise of authority. Any system with more than one individual is political because there will be a power imbalance. There cannot be two chefs cooking the same meal unless one delegates. This is power and its political. 

In my view, systems of power become contentious when you have powerful individuals supported by other powerful people, institutions, or undifferentiated masses. Such as a political party. 

Trump is currently being tried for many different alleged violations, both civil and criminal. Trump was a former and recent president of the United States. This dynamic is completely unprecedented in the balance of Anglo-American politics. Trump could have murdered 3 people with a knife on camera and admitted to it and prosecution of him would still be political. Its inescapable that the act of exercising government power against trump in the form of judicial oversight is an act of political power. Its irrelevant how much or how little Biden, or any democrat, has to do with any prosecution. Its political no matter what.  Submission to any court and its laws, under any circumstances, is a recognition of political sovereignty. The very act of Trump, an important political figure, being accused and called to answer for his crimes is political. 

Therefore, if Trump somehow wins in 2024, as a felon or otherwise, it is unthinkable that he would be able to restrain himself from challenging the political systems that tried to hold him accountable in the first place. Even if he wanted to restrain himself. Again, its politics, if he is in power he will exercise it, his supporters would command him to do so regardless, right? Given the inherent political nature of the proceedings against him, it seems obvious to me that Trump would use government power to do something equally political. 

Since the nation is already in uncharted waters trying to prosecute a former, contentious president, if Trump wins in 2024, there is an incredibly likely chance that Trump would respond in kind and legally prosecute his enemies or otherwise exercise political power in ways unseen in American political history. 

This post is a prediction, one that I feel many Trump supporters are either ignoring or they want it to happen. Either way change my view and make it easier for me to live in TrumpTown and not be so cynical of US politics. Please poke holes in my appraisal of the situation. Please give me a reason to change my view and expect a boring election cycle in 2024. 

TL;DR: Trump is being accused of felonies and other crimes. Political or not, its all politics and its unthinkable that if re-elected, convict or otherwise, Trump will launch legal actions against his perceived enemies and a dramatic political battle, unprecedented in scope and scale, will erupt if he wins 2024.","changemyview",1332,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/186p36m/cmv_a_trump_2024_presidency_would_irreversibly/"

If you don't vote, people aren't going to move towards you, they are going to move towards the people who vote. Just vote.

In one of them he says: ""...a beauty, if I weren't happily married, and, you know, his father..."", he considers ""being happily married"" the primary reason for him to not be with his daughter. On another talk show, they ask him what is his common interests with his daughter and, again, he says ""well I was going to say SEX, but I can't relate this with her..."". There are multiple instances like this, over a very long time period.

EDIT: OK, this was fun. But I'm really both surprised and tired about how many spammers are in here. So I'll address the ""sophisticated"" points you made with your extremely capable brains.1- I won't vote for Biden. I won't vote for Trump. I was not there when people decided on this electoral system where only 2 realistic options are allowed to exist. It's not my problem. If you keep insisting on continuing this joke of a system that has nothing to do with true Democracy, I won't be there.2- ""If you don't vote, you're supporting the bad guy."". No I'm not, you can't force a crappy system on me and cry after, because I don't like it. The guys I would vote for are ridiculed and silenced in US, so, naturally, no votes from me. If you want, you can join me in this protest, if you don't, it's not my problem and I'm fine with it. I'll watch the world burn until people realize how fcking stupid and unjust this electoral system is. It's a free country.

EDIT 2: I don't why, but many people somehow think that my biggest issue with Trump are these comments. They're not. He has a very long list of no-nos and this is not one of the most important ones, FOR ME. For example, he went to court for RAPE, I think that's a much more serious issue.What I am trying to understand was ""how this guy doesn't get cancelled/dismissed by the general public, even when comments like this exist?"", since I thought this is a topic that would repulse the majority of people. I guess I was wrong.

"2023-12-09",1702136078,"CMV: Trump is going to win in 2024","OK, so before you ask, no, I'm not a Republican. Ever since I've been old enough to know how the American government works, I've been a Democrat, and I don't see that changing in the near future. But this is the first time I've really felt this scared about the outcome of an election. And yes, that includes 2016. In 2016 I knew there was a chance Trump could win, but I was still shocked when it actually *happened.* And in 2020 I predicted-- correctly, as it turns out-- that he would lose to Joe Biden. But now it's 2023, and I'm not feeling optimistic at all about the 2024 election. And there are multiple reasons for that. 

1. Biden's polls are exceptionally bad, especially for an incumbent President. Normally it's tough to beat an incumbent, but people *really* don't like Biden. He's even falling behind Trump in key swing states he won in 2020, which is astonishing. 
2. Demographics that went for Biden in 2020 are starting to turn away from him, especially in the aforementioned swing states. 
3. Even if Trump is convicted in one of his upcoming trials, it's unlikely to affect him badly. At worst, his voters base will use it as an excuse to play the victim, and will turn out in droves on election day. Biden has no similar way of exciting his voters. 
4. The Israel-Hamas war has no end in sight, and is costing Biden a great deal of support with both Muslim and Jewish voters. 

To truly CMV on this, you'll have to do so on all four of the above points. As it stands, I think Trump is in a much better position to win than Biden is, and anyone who claims otherwise is simply delusional.

"2023-11-14",1699964279,"CMV: Trumps odds of winning in 2024 are significantly overstated in betting markets (currently a 50/50 on predictit)","I feel that giving trump 50/50 odds of winning the 2024 presidential election is overly generous. 

Ever since Trump initially won in 2016, Republicans have failed to win at a national level. 2018 was considered a disappointment for them, trump lost in 2020, 2022 red wave never materialized, and now suddenly were supposed to believe that 2024 will turn things around. 

For Trump to win, he needs to pick up 3 of the 6 below states- 

- Georgia
- Wisconsin
- Arizona
- Pennsylvania
- Michigan
- Nevada

Georgia went blue because of the growth of Atlanta, which has only continued to grow. The population has gone up by 300,000 people since 2020. The whole j6 and Georgia lawsuits has only served to hurt Trumps image in that state. I consider his odds of flipping that state very poor considering his position is weaker than the last time he lost.

I consider his odds to win in Pennsylvania incredibly poor, considering how his endorsement of Oz couldnt beat a disabled candidate in the senate. PA is getting bluer. 

Michigan is a lost cause for the GOP considering how Tudor Dixon performed there. 

I almost didnt include Nevada in this list because it has always felt like a stretch for the trump campaign. Its a state that has very slowly started to shift red, but Trump needs to find 30,000 votes to flip there in 24 to win it and I dont see where they will come from. 

Arizona is like 60/40 for Biden because of the continued growth of Phoenix and the unpopularity of trump there due to his arduous history with John McCain. 

And finally theres Wisconsin, which was incredibly close and I guess he could win in 24. They had a winning gop race I recently. To be nice to him, lets say that one is 60/40 for trump.

So thats 1 state that he is 60/40 likely win (Wisconsin), 1 where hes a 60/40 on the losing end (Arizona), and 4 where I consider his chance of victory to be very poor. Ill assign them 25% chances of winning each. 

Plugging those odds into a calculator online, I see that his odds of winning would really be 11.27%, rather than 50/50. 

I believe that my estimates make sense given the current environment and issues like abortion making republicans have a very difficult uphill battle with voters. Id be curious as to things Im missing with my estimates that would require I shift my view.

"2023-12-11",1702308973,"CMV: Biden / Dems have failed immensely by not raising taxes on the wealthy, which would be beneficial to the United States economy","Dems campaign heavily on taxing the ""rich"" and reducing wealth disparity.  However we have seen basically none of that.  I think taxing the rich would reduce wealth disparity, reduce inflation, and lower the deficit, and would be overall a boon to the US economy at large, and that Dems have totally failed to implement any laws to do this in spite of their promises to do just that.

I am not necessarily talking about anything like the 90% taxes like we've seen historically, or even necessarily a ""wealth"" tax.  Even something like increasing capital gains tax to match income taxes would be reasonable, and increasing the top brackets / creating new brackets for people making 10s of millions.

To clarify my points: taxing the wealthy:

A. Would reduce the deficit

B. Would reduce inflation without taxing the poor/middle class

C. Would reduce wealth disparity and many of the negative symptoms of it

D. Could be implemented in a reasonable, measured way

E. Is something the Dems have routinely promised and failed to deliver, and these days they fail to even bring up the topic

F. Fiscal policy is extremely important and the Dems are at best clowns and at worst immoral in failing to address it.

At the risk of getting away from the subject, I would also argue that many of the topics Dems focus on pale in comparison to the importance of good fiscal policy, and Dems pander with social issues instead of fixing economic issues that would have magnitudes higher benefit to the poor and middle class they claim to champion.

I would also argue Trump failed by slashing taxes during a booming economy prior to the pandemic.  The Republicans are obviously don't even pretend to want to raise taxes on the wealthy, which is why I didn't bring them up.  Although critical of the left, he intent of this post isn't to be pro-Republican, as they appear to have an even lesser chance of implementing much needed beneficial fiscal policy than the left.

I do get that we're in very sensitive, unprecedented territory with his many indictments and lawsuits, but unprecedented behavior should result in unprecedented consequences, shouldn't they? Furthermore, isn't Donald Trump ultimately the architect of all of this by choosing to proceed with his candidacy, knowing that he was under investigation and subject to potential lawsuits and indictments? If a President commits a crime on his last day in office (or the day after) and immediately declares his candidacy for the next election, should we lose our ability to hold that candidate accountable?

"2023-12-20",1703072684,"CMV: Donald Trump benefits from the Colorado ruling","With this news breaking, I think it's only going to rally up the Republicans more behind Trump, making him the nominee for the election. They will see this as an attack on democracy and give them one more reason to vote Biden out. 

I also think it's pretty obvious to everyone that SCOTUS is going to overrule this by at least 6-3 in Trump's favour. I can even see this going 9-0 depending on the reasoning and the precedent they want to set. This will be absolutely grab headlines and dominate the news even more than the Colorado ruling, giving Trump even more attention that he can feed off of. It'll basically solidify him as the Republican nominee. 

Where it goes from there depends on the ruling. If it's ruled that he can only be stopped from running if he's convicted, then we'll have to wait for the conviction, but I suspect SCOTUS will give multiple reasons for overruling Colorado, making it impossible for lawyers to stop Trump from running with the same reasoning even if he's convicted.

Edit: for the record, I agree with CO on this ruling, Trump shouldn't be allowed to hold office, but I'm not in the SCOTUS so that point is basically moot.

Edit 2: Thanks for all the responses, I have learned plenty about this case specifically.","changemyview",796,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18msqbj/cmv_donald_trump_benefits_from_the_colorado_ruling/"

The downside to this growth has been the decline of civil discussion. What was once a subreddit for discussing the history and intricacies of all of our presidents has devolved into a political echo chamber where the last 10 years dominates the previous 220. 

We attempted to combat this by eliminating all posts about future elections and limiting Trump/Biden posts to a specific day of the week but since comments about these presidents were still allowed, Trump and Biden were being brought up on completely unrelated threads. Every day the mod queue is filled with dozens of reports from people who are arguing about Trump and Biden. 90% of Rule 2 removals (Incivility) stem from modern political discussions. We also believe this undermines the historical focus of this subreddit and encourages every tier list and discussion post to turn into a fighting match between Democrats and Republicans.

The mod team has been debating over how to handle this for several months and we believe that fully banning all discussion of Trump and Biden is the best way to preserve the integrity of this subreddit at this time. Given that 2024 is an election year we are anticipating an even greater influx of members and an increase in Trump/Biden posts and comments which is why this measure is being implemented now. 

# Rule 3 will now read as follows:

**No Future or Recent Politics**

**As this is a historical subreddit, posts and comments about recent politics (e.g., Trump and Biden) and future politics (e.g. upcoming elections or future presidents) are not allowed.**

Rule 11 (Formerly the no-future election rule) has been removed as it is now redundant.

This ban will include discussions on anything related to the Trump/Biden administrations and their families. In addition to moderator enforcement we will be implementing a filter that will remove key words related to those presidents. No pictures of Trump or Biden are to be posted (tier lists being the exception) and any posts that are directly baiting people into discussing these presidents will be removed. If you see people trying to circumvent these rules please report their comments.

Clarification: Trump and Biden are entirely banned. No posts/comments about them are allowed. Even pre-2016 (No VP Biden)

We thank all members of this subreddit that have been respectful and civil when discussing our two most recent presidents.","Presidents",736,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidents/comments/1947r2a/major_changes_to_rule_3_the_trumpbiden_rule/"

According to a survey, of the 1/3 who did not vote, 20% said their reason for not voting was that they did not like the candidates.[https://www.npr.org/2020/12/15/945031391/poll-despite-record-turnout-80-million-americans-didnt-vote-heres-why](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/15/945031391/poll-despite-record-turnout-80-million-americans-didnt-vote-heres-why)

Here is my view: If you do not prefer either of the main two candidates enough to vote for one of them, you might as well *vote for someone else*.

A lot of people say ""a vote for a 3rd party candidate is a vote for (insert name of Democrat or Republican candidate)""

By definition it is not. It is a vote for someone else. And this argument fails even harder when the voter in question would not otherwise have voted for anyone.

People say that voting for a 3rd party candidate is meaningless because they won't win. But something interesting happens when a 3rd party candidate gets 5% of the vote. They become eligible for federal funding in the *next* election.

[https://transition.fec.gov/info/chtwo.htm](https://transition.fec.gov/info/chtwo.htm)

This is certainly not impossible. In 2016, both Clinton and Trump were such immensely terrible candidates that the Libertarian nominee, Gary Johnson, got 3.3% of the vote.

It's too early to say for sure, but I'd wager both major candidates in 2020 will be astonishingly difficult to vote for.

So if a potential voter's reaction to whichever two clowns they put at the top of the ballot is to vote for neither of them... why shouldn't they vote for someone else instead?

This is not to say that an undecided voter should necessarily vote 3rd party instead of trying to figure out which of the major candidates is the 'lesser evil'. My statement is only that voting for a 3rd party candidate is more useful than not voting at all.

In an ironic twist, due to the way the electoral college works, in deep red or deep blue states, voting for a 3rd party candidate may influence the result of the election more profoundly than voting for one of the two main candidates. One vote can be the difference between a major party receiving 88% or 88.0001% of the vote in a particular state... or it can be the difference between a third party receiving 4.99999999% or 5% of the vote nationwide.","changemyview",631,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/172zudm/cmv_voting_for_a_3rd_party_candidate_is_more/"

"2023-09-10",1694377356,"CMV: the federal and state governments going after DJT is a good thing, and in general the USA needs to continue its strong stance on election denial.","On the fact of it, the Biden administration has essentially been at a legal and ideological war with a large portion of the right, but what really justifies it for me is the why. 

Biden started off this battle by being brutally honest with the American people. He made it very clear that anyone who denies elections poses a serious threat ar to the USA by doing so. A good American accepts the results of elections; they dont deny them. We can disagree on the big issues, but youre not a good American if you deny that the election was fair *without proof*. And I think Biden emphasized that point perfectly. If youre an American who denies elections, American is just a description of your passport, not who you are. An American who *didnt* have contempt for everything that we stand for would not deny elections, again, without proof, and **especially** they would not deny their elections in an illegal manner.

Of course, words should be backed by actions, and, while of course Biden cant charge anybody, his DOJ has done a great job cracking down on election denial when its done in an illegal manner. For example, the DOJ has arrested multiple people on Jan 6 charges and while most are under-sentenced, it sends a good message. Same with the Jan 6 charges related to Trump and charges related to asking Georgia to overturn their election. The government has done a good job of letting the good people know that election deniers will not be tolerated. The best way to stop election denial is to absolutely crack down on it. With the Trump arrests and most importantly the Jan 6 arrests, the government has let it be known that we will *not* let election deniers harm the very fabric of this country. 

Now, to be fair, Im not saying we cant complain about the electoral process itself. Its perfectly fine to think elections should be done in x manner or y manner, but if you want to claim the process was carried out in a rigged manner, then you should have to give proof for your claim. Accusations require proof.","changemyview",602,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16faldm/cmv_the_federal_and_state_governments_going_after/"

The debate about whether our representative form of government was ever a true ""democracy"" is another topic entirely.

The US has long had a two-party democratic system. Now, one of the two parties is openly un-democratic. They support a candidate who already attempted one coup to overthrow an election, and who openly wishes to be a dictator. So from my perspective, that party is no longer participating in the democratic process, which leaves us with a... one-party democracy? Is that even a democracy at all?

In 2020 Biden ran on the premise of saving democracy from Trump. Now, entering the next election, democracy seems *even farther* from ""being saved,"" and Biden is running on the same premise again.

It seems to me that the only way out of this situation is to create a viable third-party (or rather, 2nd party, if you assume that the Republicans are not participating in democracy). If the Democratic Party is serious about ""saving democracy,"" then they should be acknowledging the vast differences between their constituents (currently, anyone who still wants the US to operate as a democracy), dividing themselves into factions (sub-parties or new parties altogether), and forming a coalition of those factions to elect leaders through a democratic process (e.g. serious primary elections for president).

Is there something I'm missing? Or is the idea basically just to stall for 4 more years and then have real primaries in 2028, assuming that somehow the specter of a Republican/anti-democratic victory will just disappear before then?

Edit: holy heck that's a lot of comments. I won't be able to respond to all of them. Let me respond to a common one here: ""so you think handing Republicans a win will somehow help?"" Absolutely not. A Republican win speeds along the failure of democracy. A Democratic win delays it. A third-party win, while exceedingly unlikely, would be the only way to 'save' democracy. There could conceivably be a middle ground where Democrats win with a third-party receiving enough support to appear viable in a future election.

Edit2: Another common argument is that we just need to wait out Trump personally, until he either dies or can't run. On this, I fundamentally disagree. I believe Trump showed the Republican party just what's possible to achieve by disregarding Democratic institutions and norms. I believe that there's a whole other wave of, frankly much more capable, Republicans waiting to follow his blueprint in the future.

Final edit: I gotta move on with my day. The general response seems to be ""suck it up for 4 more years, do something in the next primary. By then the Republicans will have changed."" I think you're wrong. I don't think they'll change. I don't think they have any reason to do so. But I hope you're right.","changemyview",558,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/190cmeb/cmv_the_democratic_party_platform_of_vote_for_us/"

"2023-11-03",1699013799,"CMV: the United States government should pay teachers similar to military service members relative to experience and education","I served in the US Army and my final rank was Sergeant (E5). I am currently a math teacher with a MS in Math plus an additional 30 graduate credit hours and 14 years of teaching experience. 

My current salary is $68,000 and I live in a rural area in Northern Georgia. While cost of living is low here, I can't help but look up what my pay would had been had I stayed in the military - even if I stay as E5, with my wife and kid, my base pay plus BAH would put me at around the same as my current salary, without the degrees and I am not even counting my qualifiers that would net higher pay. 

Both teachers and military are performing vital public services, so why is pay gap this enormous? Objectively, my job in the Army was far easier - I only need to focus on my mission and manage fewer than 5 personnel who have to complete basic training/AIT, so in a sense, self-selected. Whereas as a teacher, I am responsible for the learning outcome of 30+ young people who often do not want to be here.

I have to complete 6 years of higher education in STEM program to even get started in my teaching career for my current pay track (I would get paid even less if I only have a BS) plus it took me years in teaching before I firmly grasp the craft of education; whereas I enlisted in the Army when I was 17 with just a HS diploma, promoted to E5 after 2 years in services (I joined as E3 due to JROTC, received a waiver for E4 at 18 months TIS, then promoted to E5 in secondary zone), I know that is a bit faster than most, but I didn't really need to have much qualifications for my enlistment and promotions. 

As an E5, I was highly expendable. I get it that recruitment number are low but someone else could have easily done replaced me. Yet, as a math teacher, it is next to impossible for me to be replaced. Our department have been operating with 
 less than 75% faculty due to multiple people leaving within the past few years and we simply failed to attract new hires. As of the past 4 years, I am the only person in my department who is qualified to teach Statistics, all of us are teaching more students, committing more tutoring hours... The point is, the military recruitment shortage isn't due to low pay, but teacher shortage is.

My view is that Americans should commit to paying teachers just as much as paying military service members, after all, one cannot function without another.","changemyview",550,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17mtqet/cmv_the_united_states_government_should_pay/"

Republicans are split and in disarray.  There is a far right MAGA wing of the party that is holding congress hostage.  Rather than nominating Hakeem Jefferies who will always be limited to 212 Democratic votes, the Democrats need to nominate (and then unanimously support) someone who can get 5 Republican votes to get to the 217 needed to win.

To me, ""tolerable"" would start with someone who is not MAGA, doesn't support Trump, has condemned the attack on the capitol, etc.  Essentially, someone who maybe has different ideologies and opinions from the Democrats on what legislation should be passed, but isn't a ""right wing nut"".  Someone who genuinely wants what is best for America, but just has different opinions on what is ""best"".  Basically, the way things used to be.

A few sample names (and these are just samples, so these specific names are not part of my view that is worth challenging) could be someone like Mitt Romney, Stephanie Murphy (edit, my bad on this one, forgot she was actually a Democrat), or even Liz Cheney.  I think any one of those 3 could easily get 5 Republican votes, so if they have 100% support from the Democrats, they would win the Speakership.

Is that an outcome that the Democrats would be *happy* with?  Of course not.  But is it a better situation for the Democrats than Jordan or Scalise?  Fuck yes!  So why make an effort nominating someone you're ideological aligned with who can't win, when you could do something else and end up with someone ""less bad""?

Is the goal just to highlight the Republican infighting and make them look bad?  To what end?  Any benefits from that will be outweighed by continuing with another extremist, MAGA nut and getting nothing done but shutting down the government, cutting aid to Ukraine and trying to continue to cover up the capitol attack and Trumps other crimes.","changemyview",545,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175w2hu/cmv_the_democrats_should_forget_about_nominating/"

The lack of universal Healthcare in the country is appalling. It is a myth that countries with universal Healthcare have longer wait times or worse outcomes, in fact the opposite is true. I wrote a whole essay on this a few years ago. Healthcare is a human right, and it shouldn't be radical to believe that someone shouldn't die because they're poor. There is also massive amounts of inequality in Healthcare. 

Teachers are not paid nearly enough and are forced to take on far too much responsibility outside their job description. Many schools are overcrowded and it is ridiculous that the one tax we can regularly directly vote on is whether schools should get minute increases in funding. 

The fact that politicians can legally be largely funded by corporations is atrocious. So is the two party system and the electoral college. 

Government shutdowns: some people loose their source of income and some people are forced to work without pay. Why? Because congress couldn't come to a compromise and decides to impact millions of lives rather than being rational and negotiating with the other side. 

Do I even need to go into law enforcement? The inequal ways they treat people, especially people of color, the immunity and privilege they have in court, and the lack of training they receive causes massive problems. 

The legal system is messed up in several ways. Firstly the amount of discretion judges have is crazy. They can let someone convicted of a crime walk free or sentence them to death. People are also commonly convicted without evidence (especially people of color) and overturning a conviction can take decades, even if they have convincing evidence of innocence. 

The BLM's wild horse and burro program is also not managed well. There is over 50,000 horses in holding and even though the mission of the program is to ""manage and protect herds,"" horses can legally be shipped to slaughter under a loophole known as the 3 strikes rule. The appropriate management levels (number of equines the BLM determines the area can handle) is not based on science and is often set far to low. Livestock also get priority so much of the destruction attributed to horses is actually caused by livestock. I also wrote an essay on this lol. 

The older I get the worse my opinion of this country gets. I have personally experienced many of these issues and know that I (white middle class woman) am privileged enough to not experience many of the other issues. 

While some are much larger issues than others, I believe that every sector, no matter how big or small, has major issues that will not get fixed in the foreseeable future. 

I didn't look up specific facts or statistics for this, so please let me know if I am mistaken on anything.","changemyview",523,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1abbjq2/cmv_not_a_single_sector_of_the_us_government_is/"

"2023-10-11",1697067304,"CMV: Joe Biden has an extremely strong chance for reelection","I believe that Joe Biden will most likely win reelection by a large or larger margin than in 2020. My reasoning? Well the economy, despite inflation, has seen an improvement since 2022 and now appears to be getting better (as far as I know and have researched). Trump has now faced multiple indictments and his ties to the January 6th insurrection and support for conspiracy theories surrounding the 2020 election and his liability in a sexual assault case is enough to turn off quite a large portion of independent and undecided voters. Plus with things seemingly getting worse for Trump by the day I would honestly not be surprised if he dropped out sometime early next year.

The other republican candidates also don't have much traction and would likely be weak candidates against Biden in a general election. Ron DeSantis goes far too much into the ""woke"" crap and his anti-LGBT record will definitely make LGBT voters turn out in droves for Biden, Vivek Ramaswamy only gains traction with the far right and a majority of voters have never even heard of him, Mike Pence would dissapoint MAGA republicans due to him not supporting Trump, Chris Christie would also dissapoint MAGA and those voters would likely stay home. 

So overall, if Biden and Trump have a rematch in 2024, I believe Joe Biden would win by a large margin, Trump is simply too controversial of a person and his rhetoric and indictments will make him lose support among many voters.","changemyview",514,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175se50/cmv_joe_biden_has_an_extremely_strong_chance_for/"

"2023-10-19",1697758999,"CMV: Religious ethics have no place in policy making","I reently had a discussion with a redditor right here in a post about critique towards islam. It quickly evolved in a discussian about ethics itself. The redditor said, that they believe that secular ethics are not really defendable and lack substance, since, without a god, there is nothing to stop someone from murdering everyone for the benefit of spreading their own genes.

I hurled some secular ethical principles at them, and i am fairly sure, at the moment, that those are absolutly superior and more appliable towards almost every ethical problam that one can face, especially when deciding on laws and policies.

My view is that the main problem is, that religious laws usually lack an agreeable, rational basic principle at their core. Like, for example, the categorical imperative. Sure, there is jesus golden rule, but stuff like laws against certain kinds of food, against certain kinds of sexuality, acts, working on certain days, doing pilgrimage, celebrating certain days, etc. are pretty arbitrary .Some MIGHT made sense when they were first formulated (although, being ""divine rules"", religious people tend to deny that they were man-made, so that is hardly an argument), but many are obsolete today.

I would go further and say i currently hold that believe that every law influenced by religion is inherently unjust towards the percentage of the population that does NOT hold the religious views that influenced that law.

I personally get the impression that being religious is fine, and ordering your life according to religious rules is fine as long as those rules remain private and confined to your own life. Although i still believe that someone adhering to secular ethics because they WANT to be a good person seems like a better person to me (and safer) than someone only holding back on the mayhem because they are afraid of divine punishment (because there might be ways around drawing the deities ire, for example by targeting a group that is singled out as ""evil"" in a holy text)

So, do you think there is any benefit for society from religious ethics being applied in policy making, be it via religious politicians or through religious advisors or clerics in ethic-commitees?

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT: I changed my view slightly. I now believe that the line is to be drawn between ""bad"" and ""good"" ethics in regards to them respecting human rights and being able to be justified rationally, not between ""secular"" and ""religious"", although i still think that the majority of ""purely"" religious laws (e.g. that have no other base but ""god sais it"") fall in the ""bad"" category. So, i should have called them ""exclusivly religous laws"". Meaning laws that have no other base then religion or value religion higher than peoples human rights and freedom (for example laws against homsexuality, forbidding women to get an education, etc.). Laws that can be justified by religion or by rational process just fine (""dont kill"") dont fall in that category.**

There seem to be 4 main arguments here:

1. People telling me that without god there can be no morals. This is, if you ask me, deeply flawed and somewhat concerning. It is also impossible to reason with that kind of argument, since it is based on faith and nothing else, so i wont. Didn't convince me of anything though.
2. People saying religious law is good, with examples like ""thou shalt not kill"". This is not convincing, since you can arrive at the same conclusion using non-religious principles, and those principles don't at other rules that are arbitrary or encroach on peoples freedom (diatary laws, veils, mandatory conversions, etc.). Did not change my mind.
3. People saying that it would be impossible or bad to enforce a ban on religious influence on politics, because it would infringe on peoples freedom of thought or religion. This is a better point, but i still think it is not valid. As with the argument before: If policy-makers arrive at a conclusion that is baised on their faith, but that conclusion also rests on reason and does not violate anyones rights (""don't steal"" for example), there is no issue. Furthermore, if policy-makers enect laws that only come from THEIR religion, there is a real risk of encroaching on others freedom of though and religion (think mandatory conversion to a certain religion). Didn't convince me.
4. People saying that this is not about secular or religious ethics, but about ""good"" or ""bad"" ethics. I agree somewhat. i was thinking of guiding principles like the categorical imperative and human rights, and did not take into account secular ideologies that also have rules and ethics like, for example, nazism. I still beliebe though that religious rules that are ONLY influenced by religion and can not be justified by rationality and human rights are inherently ""bad"", because the usually infringe on peoples freedom, freedom of though and religion if enected. See point 1, 2 and 3. A ban on education for women, homosexuality, or any other mandate to impose the rules of a religion on the larger population etc. fall under that law.

There are thousands of people who would make better presidential candidates for 2024 than Biden or Trump.","Every argument for Biden or Trump to run in 2024 boils down to some version of ""status quo"" or ""inertia."" We're told that the Ds and Rs have no choice but to run these super-old candidates (and, in Trump's case, a narcissist) because there's nobody else who could be suitable.

In a nation of 332,000,000 people, there are well over 100 million who are over the age of 35, American-born, and have resided in the United States for 14 years or more - in other words, are constitutionally eligible to run for president.

Out of those 100 million, surely at least half have a basic education, are mature, sensible, decent people, and have demonstrated solid character - and also be significantly younger than Trump or Biden.

Out of those 50 million, surely at least ten million would qualify as *highly* educated - the metrics of which can be tricky to figure out (is it a master's degree? or something else?) - but they would be significantly above average. And they would be in good health as well, perhaps age 40-60.

Out of those 10 million, surely at least one million would be quite exceptional - people who have substantially high IQ, have advanced quite far in life and a career - such as being a doctor, or having worked in public governmental service for decades, etc.

And out of those million, surely at least 10,000 would have the political know-how, the charisma, the political interest, maybe have spent significant time abroad in foreign countries or speak multiple languages, to be a suitable president. Maybe Rhodes Scholars, Fulbright Scholars, etc.

There is nothing Biden has done that a thousand younger Democrats couldn't have. Nothing about this guy (who will be 86 years old when he leaves office) is so special that some 40-60 year old Democrat could not have achieved likewise had he/she been in the White House instead of Biden.

Even in Congress, state legislatures or governorships alone, there must be dozens of good, qualified, educated, experienced politicians who would be much younger than Trump or Biden, and who would make suitable presidential candidates. How about the military? There must be generals, colonels, admirals or majors who'd be good presidents. Is nobody who's served as Secretary of State, Defense, or Health and Human Services suitable? Nobody's who's spent decades in the State Department or Department of Education, Veterans Affairs, Surgeon General? There are dozens of big-city mayors in America.

I'd even bet that every Redditor here in this thread probably knows one classmate from high school or college who'd make a good president.

And yes, I know, the GOP is horrid these days, but I'd bet that in their 80-million-strong ranks, there have to still be at least ten million Republicans who are more upright and honorable than Trump.

The argument for Biden and Trump essentially boils down to incumbency, inertia and status quo.

"2024-03-10",1710093292,"CMV: Democrats are in trouble if Republicans can successfully appeal to minority voters","One of the biggest worries Democrats have for the 2024 election is that they can no longer take minority voters for granted. Their grip on minority voters was always much more lose than democrats believed. For example, I think that Hispanic and Black voters see political correctness and social liberalism in a worse light than, say, suburban women. Hispanics don't like when the left tries to force terms like ""Latinx"" on them. Black voters overall do not appreciate the general lawlessness that Democrat run cities have allowed to occur. It's black owned businesses that suffer the most from it. Both groups are less supportive of the LGBT community than the population as a whole. So I think democrats relying solely on the ""Republicans are racist"" message to keep such a critical voting bloc with them is very risky. It's already starting to unravel.

Florida is a state where the Republicans have successfully loosened the Democrats domination of the minority vote. Florida is a state where normally, the demographics would be very unfavorable to the Republicans. It is a minority-white state with huge urban and suburban populations, and not too many large swaths of rural ultra conservative white areas besides the northwest. South Florida has so many Hispanics that some consider it part of Latin America. Suburban white areas, like parts of Jacksonville, Seminole County, and Pinellas County, have trended towards Democrats, mirroring a national trend. However, unlike most of the country, Republicans have made huge gains with urban minority voters in South Florida. Miami swung 20 points to the right between 2016 and 2020, and I expect it to swing another 10 points or so to the right in 2024 and go into Trump's column.

This should terrify Democrats, because Florida is not dramatically different from other states with high minority populations. The main difference is the Florida Republican party has successfully rebranded itself from the party of socially conservative rural whites to the party of freedom, cultural traditions, and law and order. The fact that the Florida GOP has been able to effectively identify itself with Cuban and Puerto Rican voters and their traditions, combined with nonsense like people on the left pushing terms like ""Latinx"", has reduced the stigma of voting Republican in Hispanic communities. This strategy could be extremely effective in places like California, Arizona, Nevada, and Texas. And it shows just how much ground Republicans can gain with minorities. When Republicans flip the script like they have in Florida, they are the ones who stand to gain from demographic changes in our country. It is not limited to Florida. We're starting to see Hispanic South Texas shift into the Republican column. Majority-Black parts of rural North Carolina are shifting to the right, and those shifts may have been what got Trump over the finish line in 2020, and what may protect him in 2024. Trump is also up by several points in every single Arizona poll this election, consistently his best margin in any of the Biden 2020 column swing states. I see this as a developing and nationwide problem for Democrats. If they don't move to the center socially, they'll find a Florida situation on their hands nationwide.

I think Democrats are a lot more screwed than they'll admit. Tell me why I'm wrong.","changemyview",475,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bbgewn/cmv_democrats_are_in_trouble_if_republicans_can/"

"2023-09-22",1695384714,"CMV: US Immigration policy is a total shitshow","Im the definition of an immigration dove  I love immigrants. I love seeing the varied cultures people bring with them and learning about the values that people of those cultures bring with them. I love hearing the different inflections in the voices of immigrants. I love being able to access foods of dozens of countries in my community. I love the idea that my country could be so great that people uproot their entire lives and those of their families to come here and start over and improve their well-being. 

There are also numerous objective benefits immigrants bring to the USA. I remember one of my college history professors saying that one of the major reasons that the US didnt undergo a revolution or major social upheaval in the 30s was the large immigrant population. Our national unemployment is roughly non-existent and our companies need people to work jobs to continue to grow and prosper. If there was ever a time in the last century to have a generous, functional, effective immigration policy, this is it.

Which is not what we have right now. What we have is a total free-for-all at the border, that ultimately serves neither the immigrants hoping to establish a new, better, life in the USA, nor the country as a whole. Lets start with basic questions of security:

Our federal agencies have very limited operational control of the border. People constantly cross between ports of entry. Its widely known among federal agencies that cartel operators funnel migrants to mass and cross at particular locations in order to occupy Border Patrol, so they can smuggle contraband in the vacated crossings. The shear mass of numbers of migrants crossing overwhelm the ability of Border Patrol to vet them, allowing only the most cursory of background checks, which will completely miss any criminality in their home country. And this is only for the migrants who surrender themselves/are caught by Border Patrol. Some of the contraband that the cartels smuggle over are human beings who, for one reason or another, want to stay off of the federal governments radar.

The way most of these migrants are hoping to normalize their status in the United States is the asylum process. Many of them are unaware that at best this is a temporary patch on a system that will eventually leave them in legal limbo. It is easy to claim asylum, but not so easy for it to be granted. To claim it, you pretty much just have to say that you have a credible fear of being persecuted back in your home country. At this point the migrant will receive a notice to appear (NTA) before an immigration judge where that claim will be adjudicated. At the point, the migrant is generally free to go where they please. They may apply for a work permit six months after making this claim. So they can start their lives, get a job, etc. while they are waiting to be actually granted asylum, but what many do not understand is that asylum is only granted for credible fear of persecution based on a narrow set of criteria. Even though it takes years for those asylum claims to be adjudicated, at the end of the day only about 15% of claimants are granted asylum. Because ICE only prioritizes deportations of serious criminals, those who are denied asylum still generally remain in the US, but they have no legal status and are extremely vulnerable to changes in policy or political leadership.

Both of these are batshit crazy ways to run a country: a functionally open border, and a pathway to status normalization that fails 15% of the time. The alternative for a migrant, of course, is to apply for a visa in the legal way, but this is a laughable solution. There is no visa category of economic immigrant. You either need to have a family member who is already a citizen, highly educated, professional job qualifications in specific fields, or lots and lots of money. There is NO legal pathway for someone who wants to just come to the United States to be a roofer, or a restaurant worker. Actually, thats not totally true. There are H2B visas. However, the US only gives out 66,000 of those a year, and they are by statute temporary visas with no pathway to permanent residency. 

This is no way to run a railroad. I have no problem with the number of immigrants coming into the United States, but I do want the government to be sure they are the right ones. Certainly most who are coming are decent people, but the government needs to at least have the ability to sort out the few bad actors and deny them entry. Allowing bad actors and contraband through is a great way to radicalize public opinion against immigration and stoke racial and ethnic resentment and paranoia. It also needs a sane visa process for economic migrants. Having millions of rejected asylum-seekers living underground lives, open to exploitation, and in a precarious legal condition is a terrible way to bring in immigrants. 

I hated the idea of Trumps wall when he ran on it in 2016, but it pains me to say that I think it needs to be built. Its definitely not a solution in and of itself, but it can at least start the process of creating an orderly immigration system. Some might ask how the US would pay for improved border security and visa processing (I dont see this as an ingenuous concern considering US federal spending practices, but it can at least be addressed and knocked down). Well, cartels are charging virtually everyone who crosses the US border between $5000 and $10000 each (taking advantage of our ineptitude to enrich their coffers). Even if we undercut their prices by 50% to charge immigration fees to applicants, these fees would offset much of the cost, and allow migrants to use the remainder of their savings to take routes from their home countries to the United States that are safer than a trek through the Darien Gap and a 1000 mile ride on the top of a Mexican train.

This is long enough already, but one final thought I need to include is that another direct result of this ineptitude is the enabling of the explosive enrichment and growth of the cartels. Its created an opportunity for them to charge these enormous travel fees to migrants and smuggle contraband of all kinds across the border. Their annual revenue has ballooned into the billions of dollars and the US runs the real risk that in the future they could completely overrun the Mexican government and establish a true narco-state just across the border. (For those thinking that Im being hyperbolic, Mexicos annual tax revenue is $22 billion. The cartels estimated annual revenue is $13 billion. I know who my money is on in the long term, considering how much more the government has to spend money on other than security compared to the cartels.)

Maybe thats the kind of thing that will be necessary before the United States takes immigration seriously, but at that point any hope of the sane, generous, orderly immigration policy that I think we need will be lost. Theres no way thats happening once our southern neighbor become the Republic of Sinaloa.","changemyview",457,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16p8ny1/cmv_us_immigration_policy_is_a_total_shitshow/"

It seems that MAGA conservatives and left-wing radicals alike are open to isolating the US from our NATO allies, which I think would be a generationally awful foreign policy blunder, ultimately resulting in bloody war in Europe. 

While this may have been a different discussion in early 2020, Putin has now made his imperial ambitions and willingness to wage war clear. His invasion of the sovereign state of Ukraine was an unprecedented violation of all the laws and norms of war Europe established after World War 2. Putin has made his ambition to recapture other former Soviet Republics clear, and it seems self-evident that the only thing stopping Putin from eventually invading NATO allies is his fear of triggering NATO's Article 5 and falling into a war with the United States.

While other NATO members have their own armies, they suck. [All other NATO allies combined have a smaller fighting force than Russia or the US](https://www.statista.com/statistics/584286/number-of-military-personnel-in-nato-countries/), and their technology and training are generally regarded as woefully inadequate. Turkey is the only other NATO ally with a decent army, but they're also the most unreliable in the alliance (along with Hungary). Without the guarantee of US mutual defense, I don't think that the threat of European NATO allies alone would be enough to deter further Russian expansion once they finish the war in Ukraine, and have the time to rebuild their army.

As always, I'm open to genuine folks trying to change my mind on this assessment. ","changemyview",454,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1arpifv/cmv_leaving_nato_would_be_one_of_the_worst/"

It usually assumes that democracy is more moral than authoritarianism (which I agree with to a certain extant), therefore the USA's foreign policy is broadly moral.

But that's just not true.

America allies with undemocratic states all the time, most notably Egypt and Saudi Arabia today, but also in the past. South Korea and Taiwan were dictatorships until 1987. Pakistan has shifted between democracy and military rule numerous times. The USA has often directly propped up dictators in other places as well like South Vietnam and Indonesia to secure their economic interests. Sometimes they even toppled governments that were elected democratically or were in favour of democracy, like in Iran and countless times in Latin America.

This pattern in foreign policy cannot be explained by the USA's willingness to protect democracy, but its willingness to secure its own economic interest. Egypt controls the Suez Canal and Saudi Arabia controls the oil supply. The USA must work with these authoritarian countries to ensure control over its own economic interests. 

Can someone please explain to me how so many Americans believe that the USA is the bastion of democracy? I would like to hear examples of the USA pursuing actively democracy in another country despite taking a potentially big hit to its own economy.","changemyview",436,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aj04n2/cmv_the_usas_foreign_policy_is_not_to_promote/"

With a stroke of a pen, the US can determine if millions of Yemenis are going to starve to death. By moving a Navy ship into the South China Sea, the US forces all countries nearby to be defensive again. Millions of Ukrainian lives are dependent on whether the US approves military aid or not. And of course, by installing a few CIA agents in a foreign country, it has the capability to reshape the societal and political picture of a country completely. I don't think your average American knows much about all of these the same way they do about domestic policies. Just to be clear, I'm not commenting on the morality of these individual actions, some are justified and some are not, debating that is not what this CMV is about.

I would go further and say that this ignorance of American impact on the globe has allowed people in power, capitalists and politicians, to truly steer the foreign policy of the country. This is especially evident in the Iraq War and Vietnam War, and I'm sure others more familiar with American historical foreign policies can bring up more examples.

Edit: people seem to misunderstood that I'm saying America Bad. No I'm not, which is why I'm using Yemen and Ukraine as examples of America doing something good. I'm saying that American  voters don't care about these policies as much as they should given the impact they have on the globe.","changemyview",434,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18p6pth/cmv_most_americans_are_oblivious_to_the_impact_us/"

Already, that area is not rideshare friendly at all, we know this from the fact that this is the third year in a row we went there.

Last year, this local taxi company (Carbon Taxi) helped us out when we were able to get a rideshare to dinner but not back to our hotel.

This year, we weren't so lucky when using Carbon Taxi, though we did luck out with the fact that there was a greater abundance of rideshare.

When I called Carbon taxi to reserve some rides, I got this message:

***You're calling Carbon Taxi. We are no longer in business and cannot help you out. Thank Joe Biden for this because nobody wants to get off their fat ass and go to work. Thank you for your call!***

This is what was said, literally verbatim. Don't believe me? Call 570-325-5466 for a good laugh. Or a good cry, I don't care.

Mind you, I know Jim Thorpe PA is an impoverished mountain town, the type who votes for Donny, but Jesus Christ.

Joe Biden has nothing to do with it. Your business failed because of you. You failed to adapt, you failed to pay employees a respectable amount, you failed to make yourself more enticing as an employer. It's not Biden's fault nobody wants to work. It's not a matter of ""nobody wants to work."" Nobody wants to work for you. If they wanted to work for you, they'd work for you. People probably don't want to work for you for a multitude of reasons, Biden being zero of them.

Biden's got higher priorities aside from shuttering a taxi company in a small town in Pennsylvania.

The fact that you openly blamed Biden and put it in your voicemail greeting is a new level of pathetic, and this is coming from someone who didn't vote for him.

**Edit: verbatim from voicemail.**

**Edit 2: What I meant by this was that Biden's policies may impact small businesses in one way or another, but I don't think Biden or any of his policies influence people to not go to work.**

**For that matter, I don't see how a lack of manpower would shutter a taxi business. IF anything, it would leave it MORE profitable because there's little to no payroll. Maybe it was the OWNER who didn't want to get off his 'fat ass' to work. If he wanted to keep his business alive, he would have gotten up and started driving.**","changemyview",430,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bt83hg/cmv_biden_has_nothing_to_do_with_your_business/"
"2023-08-29",1693272003,"CMV: The government should pay people ¬100k euro if they donate a kidney to someone who needs one","I'm going to use numbers from my own countries as reference:  

In Belgium, a year's worth of dialysis treatment costs the government roughly ¬60k per year per patient. Meanwhile, a kidney from a healthy live donor lasts on average between 15-20 years with relatively minimal other costs after transplant.   
So let's assume 15 years of dialysis saved on average that would mean that 1 transplant saves the government roughly ¬800k (assuming ¬100k in total for surgery + medical follow-up of donor and recipient).   

I think to encourage more people to donate their kidney, the government should pay people ¬100k. Even with such a large payment, it would still lead to big savings for the government. And obviously, the recipient would benefit greatly as well due to massively increased QoL.    

And because I know people will bring up the health impacts on the donor: I don't consider this to be enough of an impact to not implement this plan. A thoroughly screened and healthy donor sees an extremely limited (if any) impact on their life. A month after the surgery, the donor can resume life as normal without any restrictions whatsoever. And the odds of developing kidney failure later in life are also very small when properly screened.    

And even if kidney failure is developed, there would be plenty of donors ready to give a kidney due to the high payment involved.","changemyview",429,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1644dcp/cmv_the_government_should_pay_people_100k_euro_if/"

We dont really have healthcare, or good free education, and if you dont think the government should pay for that fine, but even as it stands now it isnt affordable. Average people in this country arent paid enough to take care of their medical costs in retirement or pay for their children to pursue higher education. Their children often take out loans for college, financially burdening them for years to come. We focus on working more to get buy, all while automating things like content creation and art. Why is our nation so obsessed with menial work, to me it seems like technology should be enabling us to provide for our society with less labor hours, yet since people have had more computers and access to automation, they work more. 

This isnt an anti capitalist argument, nor socialist nor communist. I worry that any systems we have conceived of are no longer relevant to the average person. 

We need to prioritize the general quality of life with healthcare, food, public spaces, housing, environment protection etc.

"2024-01-07",1704611439,"CMV: American progressives should stop calling themselves ""democratic socialists""","A decent number of left-wing political figures have gained prominence and influence in American politics over the last few years. Some of the most notable include Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, and Cori Bush. They represent a growing progressive wing in the Democratic Party that has flexed some weight by pushing Joe Biden to the left during his presidency. However, while they are making decent gains, the left-flank of the party has effectively shot itself in the foot by proudly embracing the label of democratic socialist.

All of the aforementioned progressive leaders have self-described as democratic socialists. This is dumb for many reasons, but by far the biggest reason is because it's not even accurate to their political or economic positions. Democratic socialism is, before anything else, a form of socialism. It entails a fundamental overthrow of a capitalist free-market economy, putting the the workers in control of the means of production. But the high-profile progressives who so readily adopt the label don't even remotely advocate for that. Their primary agenda includes an expansion to the US social safety net, adding programs such as Medicare for All, free public college, and universal childcare. They also support a $15 minimum wage, a Green New Deal, and a more equitable tax system. None of those policies constitute socialism, democratic or otherwise, by any stretch of the imagination. On the contrary, many of those programs and policies are already commonplace in the vast majority of market-based liberal democracies. The so-called democratic socialist elected officials are very clearly social democrats, a system that maintains a market-economy but places a heavy emphasis on things like social welfare, economic regulations, and worker protections. This is the system that the Nordic countries follow. The fact that Bernie frequently points to Nordic countries as a model to emulate further drives home the fact that he is a social democrat, not a democratic socialist. 

The next problem with their erroneous self-designation is that it completely alienates wide swaths of voters right off the bat. I'm not saying it's right, but millions of Americans view socialism as an instant deal-breaker, and that includes Democrats. Progressives lose out on numerous potential supporters when they proudly claim the mantle of democratic socialism. The worst part is that the progressive agenda is highly popular according to polling, with many of its most important proposals garnering well over majority support among the American public. If Bernie and the others ran on the exact same policies but argued that they were common-sense reforms to our current system that most of the developed world takes for granted rather than a revolutionary socialistic vision, I sincerely believe we would be in a very different place right now.

For those reasons, I strongly believe progressive political leaders should ditch the democratic socialist label once and for all. Unfortunately, they've been associated with the label for so long that winning over skeptical voters might be a lost cause. In that case, I hope the next slate of progressive politicians who enter the political arena will build on the work of their predecessors and broadly embrace their agenda while completely reworking the messaging around it.

I'd love to hear any contradictory opinions. Thanks!","changemyview",388,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/190mh6r/cmv_american_progressives_should_stop_calling/"

&gt; Sound logic.  It's already statistically proven that people ost reviews more often when they had a bad experience.  If it was a good experience, you may see one out of 20 people give a rave review.

  
- People are motivated by emotion and negative emotions win out over positive in mobilizing *actions*.

"2023-04-16",1681658086,"The US Senate is arbitrary, lacks democratic legitimacy, and must be reformed to reflect the will of the people. What would be some good changes?","The US Senate consists of two senators from every state, each of whom go on to have the same voting power as every other senator in the Senate chamber. This is ignorant of the fact that different states have vastly different-sized constituencies, leading to a disproportionate system wherein representation is radically skewed, because the Senate's balance of power is determined NOT by the will of the people; but by the random chance of which areas and which votes are favored or disadvantaged by the state map.

For example, with 2020 census state populations, it would be possible for a 52% majority in the Senate to have been elected by only 17.6% of the 50 states' population.

This arbitrary bias of the Senate is part of the reason why we have two Dakotas; people in the Dakota territory wanted more power in the Senate, and two states means twice the Senate votes, regardless of how many people really live there.

A fair and proportionate Senate wouldn't be dependent upon state lines, meaning that territorial reform such as state border changes and admission of new states could be handled as its own issue, instead of being turned into a partisan scheme to manipulate the Senate.

MY SOLUTION:

I propose a Senate that gives each state a delegation with voting power proportional to population, and each major political party in the state nominates one Senator to the delegation, plus a state-legislature-nominated Senator. Then, in the general election, each voter selects one of those Senator nominees, and the vote percentage achieved by each Senator becomes the percentage of their state delegation's total voting power that they get to exercise in the Senate chamber.

This would create a far more representative Senate, because voting power is distributed directly according to population and the will of the people. It would make every vote count and protect minorities by making sure each delegation gives both sides the voice they vote for. It would also create a healthy example of checks and balances- State governments get to have a say, but only so much as their constituents agree.

"2024-01-29",1706526263,"CMV: Suicide prevention policies have more in common with blasphemy laws, more than they do with public health policy. They are motivated more strongly by the fear that life might be bad, than the conviction that life is good.","Let's imagine that you are throwing a big party for your family and friends. You've put in a lot of work, and you're confident that everyone in attendance is going to have a great time. The very last thing that you'd think to do would be to hire a firm of big, burly bouncers to guard the doors of your house to keep people *in* and make sure that nobody can leave before you had decided that the party had ended. If the party was any good, you would expect the guests to choose to stay of their own volition, without any threats of coercion, and without their exit being blocked.

Imagine that you had attended such a party, you decided after about an hour that you weren't having a good time and decided that you wanted to leave; and you found that your path was blocked by a large, beefy security guard. When you explained that you would like to leave, he told you that the party was objectively wonderful and that your decision to leave was evidence that you were of unsound judgement. Therefore, by continuing to detain you at the party, he was actually protecting your own best interests against your faulty judgement. Would you humbly accept that you were, in fact, wrong in your assessment of the party and that your decision to leave is symptomatic of a profound impairment in your capacity to make decisions that reflect your rational best interests? Or would you be more likely to conclude that the fact that strongarm tactics had to be employed to stop you from leaving was, in fact, evidence of deep insecurity on the part of the host?

Blasphemy laws in Islamic countries work on a similar principle to this. These laws don't exist because a Muslim's faith in his religion is so strong that there is nothing that could ever possibly be said to cause his belief to waver in the slightest. They exist for the opposite reason - because faith in Islam, or any other empirically unproven belief system is dependent on mutual confirmation from the people around oneself. If everyone around you, and all the people that you admire and respect, share the same belief system and the same strong faith, then you will most likely retain your own strong faith as well. However, if all around you, people that you generally hold in high esteem for their intelligence and level-headedness start to express deep-seated doubts about what they (and you) have been taught to believe, then there is a strong chance that, over time, your own faith will start to weaken.

If you depend on your faith to provide you with your sense of meaning and purpose in life; then this process of finding your faith start to falter can be extremely distressing, and this is why you might be driven to develop defence mechanisms to try and prevent you from being exposed to any evidence or alternative viewpoint which contradicts your own worldview.

I believe that the same process is in play when we talk about suicide. It can't have gone unnoticed by many that we are currently in the grips of a moral panic concerning the subject of suicide, which is being portrayed as an ongoing public health emergency. From the amount of suicide prevention campaigns that we get in the UK, and from the urgency that governments are being called upon to act to reduce suicide rates in the UK, you would fully expect that people were positively queuing up all day, every day, to jump from Tower Bridge into the Thames. When in fact, we have not seen a recent upsurge in the suicide rates in the UK, and suicide rates in the UK remain low by European and worldwide standards.

All suicide prevention schemes, without exception, draw upon the same tired old stereotypes and tropes about suicidal people being emotionally unstable and are in urgent need of treatment for a presumed mental health issue. They have constructed a rhetorical fortress whereby any person asking for the right to be suicide can be summarily discredited as ""mentally ill"" (i.e. they are unreliable witnesses to their own thoughts, and cannot be taken seriously) and in urgent need of mental healthcare. Conveniently for proponents of suicide prevention, these presumptions of mental illness are completely unfalsifiable, and in merely making the insinuation that someone is mentally ill, you open up a credibility gap between the suicidal person who is deemed unsound of mind, and the rest of society who has a paternalistic duty of care to make sure that the suicidal person does not have the opportunity to make plans to act based on their allegedly compromised mental state.

As a general principle, I think that if you feel confident that your opinion is well informed, then you don't mind allowing people on the opposite side of the debate to put across their ideas, and to have an open exchange of ideas. I don't think that you would need to try and portray your interlocutor as being mentally deranged, or assert that they've been possessed by the devil in order to shut down their viewpoint before they've even had the chance to express it. You'd let them speak, and then you would calmly go through their argument, point by point, and show them the errors in their reasoning. For example, it doesn't seem that atheists are quite as defensive about their ideas as devoutly religious folk; as firstly, atheists are simply advancing the null hypothesis with relation to God's existence, and usually don't seem to be as strongly emotionally invested in their perspective as theists are. But as we see from blasphemy laws, devout theists are often very defensive about their beliefs, even to the point where they are prepared to use extreme violence to shut down any opposing perspective

Although suicide prevention advocates aren't typically resorting to stoning people to death for expressing heterodox views about bodily sovereignty (which would, of course, defeat the purpose of suicide prevention); people on that side of the debate do seem to get very ""triggered"" by any suggestion that there is more moral complexity to the issue of suicide prevention than they are willing to allow. After years of debating the issue of the right to suicide on Reddit and Twitter/X; one trend that I've noticed is that many of the people who are most passionately opposed to the right to die are people who themselves report having had suicidal thoughts in the past, or even being suicidal in the present. This puts me in mind of anecdotes about homophobic Christian preachers who later go on to be exposed to be soliciting the services of male prostitutes. It seems, from the outsider's perspective, that denouncing homosexuality as sinful and perverse is how they go about resolving their own private internal conflicts. One wonders whether the same might be true about many of the people who are among the most vociferous opponents of the right to suicide.

It is my personal psychoanalytical theory that the aggressiveness of the suicide prevention lobby often stems from the same form of dissonance between the person's innate biological drive to resist death at all costs, and their nagging suspicions (suspicions that they wish to suppress) that people advocating for the right to die might actually be on to something about the ultimate futility of humanity's plight. As this is merely my armchair psychoanaylsis and I am unable to see into the minds of the people who are passionate supporters of suicide prevention, I am open minded to any evidence that might change my view on this.

To avoid any misinterpretations of my argument; one thing that I'm NOT arguing is that everyone secretly hates life and wants to die. I'm not arguing that most people see life as being bad for themselves. However, I think that many people do realise that life is essentially a zero sum game, and that in order for them to be winning, someone else has to be losing. For example, in order for me to be able to affordably clothe and entertain myself living in a developed nation, this requires sweatshop workers to be toiling in sweatshop conditions to produce the clothes for pennies an hour. In order for me to indulge my love of travel, I have to contribute to global warming. And in order for each person to enjoy their lives as individuals, they kind of depend on other people sticking around (whether by choice, or by force) so that they don't have to live their life mired in loneliness and grief. If people were freely allowed to commit suicide, then I think that a lot of people know that there's a risk that the whole enterprise of human life would be exposed as a house of cards that was prone to collapse if people couldn't be forced to stick around to be exploited for the benefit of those who are more fortunate.","changemyview",337,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1adss07/cmv_suicide_prevention_policies_have_more_in/"

"2024-04-02",1712055189,"CMV: the theory of patriarchy and feminism is trumped by the theory of class","so first, definitions:   
Patriarchy: a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it.  
2nd definition: Within feminist scholarship, patriarchy has been understood more broadly as the system in which men as a group are constructed as superior to women as a group and as such have authority over them.  

So given this, we can all easily name women in positions of power, and we can probably name quite a few women that are vastly richer than you and I as indivuduals are.  
We can name instutitions like custody courts where the odds are stacked against men, as well as prison sentences being higher for men.

Somone said that these things exist because it's rooted in the patriarchal idea that men should be providers and that women are inherently more ""innocent"", hence the aforementioned injusticies...

...I just think it's all negated once we look at men, and women who have ""fuck you""-money, and today there are both men and women that are self-made in the upper echelons of society, collectively fucking over both sexes. Therefore I think the definitions of patriarchy are flawed.

thoughts?

edit: maybe instead of flawed, it can be argued it's not over encompassing. it's not possible to look at every facet through the patriarchal lens, I guess is more apt.

However, I am becoming very concerned about students using AI for tasks large and small. I am even more concerned about the academic institutions refusal to ban it in most circumstances, to the point that I think it may be time for me to show myself to the exit door. In my opinion, using this new technology stifles the ability to think flexibly, discourages critical thinking, and the ability to think for oneself, and academic institutions are failing miserably at secondary education for not taking a quick and strong stance against this. As an example, I had students watch a psychological thriller and give their opinion about it, weaving in the themes we learned in this intro to psychology class. This was just an extra credit assignment, the easiest assignment possible that was designed to be somewhat enjoyable or entertaining. The paper was supposed to be about the *students opinion*, and was supposed to be an exercise in critical thinking by connecting academic concepts to deeper truths about society portrayed in this film. In my opinion, using AI for such a ridiculously easy assignment is totally inexcusable, and I think could be an omen for the future of academia if they allow students to flirt with/become dependent on AI.

We cant take your guns, yet. We dont have the votes in your conservatives state. We took Chris from Californias guns, and Wendy from Washingtons guns in the meantime though. 

The point is, for the side that likes to gaslight gun owners by trying to convince us that nobody wants to take your guns the second that they win their elections, they start trying to push gun control legislation that involves taking your guns. 

Whether its Red Flag Laws, or outright bans, they absolutely want to take your guns. Ive been fortunate enough in my red state to convince more moderate Democrat friends, who care about their guns, to avoid voting for the idiots trying to ban guns& in my state its a very common tactic for Democrats to rally behind a moderate who doesnt have a position on gun rights, but if they get elected in either the legislature, the governors seat, or to the federal government, they start voting along party lines in favor of gun control. 

This doesnt even begin to scratch the surface either, just look at Bidens ATF going off the rails trying to make regulations to ban certain types of firearms, and now trying to unilaterally ban private gun sales.

"2024-03-29",1711724412,"CMV: Of all the Western Democracies systems, the British Parliamentary System is the least democratic of them all","This may be a bit of grass is greener on the other side effect, but every time I learn about how other countries operate their democracies, I can't help but feel like the British Parliamentary System is worse. There are a few key things about this system:

1. First past the post within each constituency. This system essentially makes sure that the Prime Minister always belongs to one of two parties. Third-party votes are usually seen as throwaway votes.

2. The party with the 2nd most votes will almost never end up with power, while the 3rd sometimes does. When there's a hung parliament, it's frustrating that it's the 3rd party or some smaller parties that end up with the king-making power. How does a party with some 10% of the total votes have the mandate to determine who the next Prime Minister should be?

3. Prime Minister can be changed by the ruling party without a mandate. In the UK, we have had 2 Prime Ministers in the past 2 years that are not elected by the voters. The last PM to get voted in was Boris Johnson, a relic figure in the context of British politics.

4. The Prime Minister can call an election whenever it pleases them. In recent years, Theresa May and Boris Johnson have called elections when they fancied it (worked out for one but not the other though). And now Rishi Sunak is trying to drag the election as long as he can because he's at a disadvantage. Elections should be scheduled so because the ruling party should not get to choose a date that best suited them.


5. House of Lords. Why the fuck is this still a thing?

To me all of this combined means that whoever wins the General Election, which can be a highly unrepresentative win because of FPTP and gerrymandering, the ruling party or parties is granted by the system an absurd amount of power and control for the next few years.

I'm sure some people will complain about the Electoral College, which I have [here](https://redd.it/1b8tus6), but at least in the US, Americans get to vote for the Senate and the House separately, which are incredibly powerful and often misalign with the President. State autonomy and Supreme Court also further divide the political power up between institutions, so while the EC is horrible, at least the democratic system as a whole is pretty healthy.

I'd like to hear how other systems are worse than the British Parliamentary System and its derivative in other countries.","changemyview",226,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bqrdky/cmv_of_all_the_western_democracies_systems_the/"

There seems to be a disconnect over how politicians and law and regulation is overall started in the United states. Many people will give a pass to a person who voted for a politican who enacts a bad policy for their state country or city. It all starts origin wise with a vote by the people for a person or proposition to enact a law. 

For example the people in states like Texas and Idaho and other states with complete abortion bans (even the life of the mother is really just on paper) if you are a conservative person who has been voting republican your whole life and saw the extremist pro forced birth laws creep in your state year after year you can't be surprised by your state now post dobbs going full abortion ban. Many will say it's counter productive to do this as it could drive people away from changing their beliefs and voting for another person party or policy. But I believe that confronting someone with that fact that these polices that are enacted are in fact started by a vote. Many people feel that their votes are not causes for bad policy and can divorce their responsibility for their vote for harmful policy. Many ""left wing"" Podcasters claimed this about blaming Trump voters in 2016 by saying you couldn't blame them for voting for him. 

And so people don't think I'm leaning politically one way or another I think that way about a voter in the south side of Chicago who bemoans gang violence but won't vote for another alderman or state representative or voters who are upset about rising crime yet vote for people who support cashless bail or abolishing bail altogether.","changemyview",205,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19a7yjm/cmv_voters_can_and_should_be_blamed_for_the/"

"2024-02-13",1707850940,"CMV: The media is corrupted by needing access. The US needs government funded but separate media like the BBC News agency.","In the past the news media made enough money to have beat reporters just standing around government places and reporting what they saw and heard.  They couldn't be denied access by law and if ever a government body tried to keep them out it would instantly be huge news.  Now there are no beat reporters so reporters need to build relationships to get access.  When a reporter in the White House press briefing room complains that none of his questions (or the questions of many of the smaller media outlets) are being answered the mainstream media shout him down because they need to maintain their ""access"" to the White House.

When the media needs to cultivate access they are no longer independent.  When the media needs to chase an audience they are no longer reporting the news and trying to minimize the bias in their reporting.

The BBC News has beat reporters and doesn't need to chase money.  They can be run like an old school news agency.  They could have access by law.  If one less biased agency was reporting a story that the mainstream media is suppressing the mainstream media would be shown to be corrupt so they would have to at least do a better job of being actual news people to not be embarrassed.

The 4th estate is supposed to be a check on government ... but that's only true if they are doing the serious job of investigating and chasing stories of the government actions.

At least that's what I think.

Edit: I want some way to get the news media to put less spin on things and to report stories the government doesn't want covered.  This is the best way I've come up with to put that influence back into the world.  There are independent media on YouTube but they are subject to the vagaries of major corporations and those corporations do things like censor for foreign governments and our government and their advertisers.  I want there to be a protected space for them.","changemyview",179,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aq1hls/cmv_the_media_is_corrupted_by_needing_access_the/"

I know it's a bit of an older clip, but I happened to come across it and had some thoughts. I find it a bit laughable that the essence of Jon's whole argument here is that because one registers to vote, registering firearms is not an infringement. I'm not sure if he's on purpose trying to pretend that ""register"" means the same thing in both contexts, or that he thinks maybe people won't catch that he's essentially trying to argue that giving the government access to what and how many guns you own is the same as voter enrollment. I'm not sure if he actually believes that registering property works in the same context, or if that's just what it seemed like. In my mind registering firearms works more akin to poll taxes and ""literacy tests"" that were tossed years ago.

"2023-12-28",1703773508,"CMV: Climate change is by far and away the most likely candidate to cause human extinction","Edit: Climate change here refers to broader ecological impact of humankind, not necessarily just climate.

When talking about possible candidates to cause human extinction, people often bring up AI, weapons of mass destruction, or asteroid impact. I feel like none of these pose a credible threat to the existence of humans. Don't get me wrong, some of them can absolutely cause significant damage to humankind, but not extinction-level.

For AI to cause an extinction level event, it requires a. the AI to be able to operate completely independently from humans, b. have the motivation to eliminate humans, and c. humans to surrender all autonomy to the AI. I just don't see how our survival instinct and forewarnings via sci-fis will allow any of these to take place.

For nuclear or biological warfare to eliminate humankind, it requires one party to be willing to eliminate oneself, the enemy and all third parties. Unless some kind of social collapse happens, I don't see a world where a country would be willing to do that, or even risk that. Don't get me wrong, a nuclear war will kill a lot of people, but to kill all humans requires a country to make that move intentionally.

Asteroids of the kind that kill the dinosaurs happen once every tens of millions of years, and we'd spot them very easily. I don't think it's a credible threat at all. 

Climate change, on the other hand, can lead to runaway climate change, or destruction of our food or water supply, or change the atmospheric composition so it's no longer habitable for humans, and so on. At the end of the day, humans are dependent on nature and if nature changes drastically enough humankind can collapse. Can climate change lead to a depletion of resources that then leads to nuclear warfare? Yeah, but the root cause of that extinction is still man-made climate change.","changemyview",168,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18sv3ne/cmv_climate_change_is_by_far_and_away_the_most/"

Florida law currently prohibits 16 and 17-year-olds from working before 6:30 a.m., after 11:00 p.m., or for more than eight hours when there is school the next day. The bill would do away with those restrictions, as well as the requirement for a 30 minute break after four consecutive hours of work.

I believe these types of laws would allow employers to pay less and offer less benefits, under the guise of providing 'spending money' jobs to teenagers. This is effectively rolling back all of the progress that US workers have been fighting to gain for over 100 years, and is moving us down a path of further class separation by offering unequal access to education for children.","changemyview",165,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16nnc07/cmv_bills_to_weaken_child_labor_laws_are/"

1. He was strongly opposed to a national bank which contributed to the financial Panic of 1837.
2. He nominated personal acquiatences to cabinet positions they were unqualified for.
3. I can look past his ownership of slaves due to historical relativism, but he banned the sharing of anti-slavery literature in Southern states which violates the 1st Amendment and tried, unsuccessfully, to ban it nationwide.
4. The elephant in the room is the Trail of Tears. Jackson ignored the Supreme Court's decision which claimed the Indian Removal act was Unconstitutional and forced Natives off of their land and into reservations. Many of them were subjected to harsh conditions from weather and disease which led to over 13,000 deaths.

His biggest accomplishments that I will give him credit for will be eliminating property/wealth requirements to be allowed to vote and paying off the national debt, but I don't think that saves his reputation overall. 

I have no issues at all with him being removed from the $20 bill in the near-future.","changemyview",158,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aucirm/cmv_andrew_jackson_was_a_bad_president/"

The documents, according to the federal indictment, including several pertaining to the ""nuclear capacity of a foreign country"" and at least one document dealing with ""nuclear weaponry of the United States."" Some of these documents were ""so closely held, only the president, a Cabinet-level or near-Cabinet level official [could authorize others to know.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/09/06/trump-nuclear-documents/)"" There's been lots of speculation as to the reason why Trump would have interest in such documents to begin with, let alone why he would think he was entitled to take them.

Trump said something really curious to Hannity during an interview in March that seems to expose a horrifying possible reason: Trump took these documents with the intent to sell them back to the US government. Trump was asked why he took the documents:

&gt;This is the Presidential Records Act. I have the right to take stuff. Do you know that they ended up paying Richard Nixon, I think, $18 million for what he had? They did the Presidential Records Act. I have the right to take stuff. I have the right to look at stuff. But they have the right to talk, and we have the right to talk. This would have all been worked out. All of a sudden, they raided Mar-a-Lago, viciously raided Mar-a-Lago.

I may be getting some details wrong here, but as I understand this, in 2000, the US government settled with the Nixon estate to the tune of $18 million for seizing presidential papers in the course of the Watergate investigation. Nixon's estate had argued that the Fifth amendment provided that the government couldn't take ""private property & for public use, without just compensation. It was a strong argument, so they settled. but the President Records Act was written in the aftermath to make all presidential records public.

The problem with Trump's comparison is twofold: Classified nuclear secrets aren't presidential records, and in any case, the Presidential Records Act made all presidential records public and therefore the fifth amendment is irrelevant.

So, back to the quote. Why did Trump say that about the $18 million in reference to the documents he took to Mar-a-lago?

The only explanation I can fathom is that Trump misrememberedor perhaps never actually fully understooda story about Nixon receiving money for documents turned over to the government. And so at the end of his term, he decided to take some home to do the same thingperhaps thinking that the more sensitive the documents, the more valuable they'll bewith the full intention that the government would come asking for them back, and he would be compensated for them. One interpretation of when he says ""They have the right to talk, and we have the right to talk, This would have all been worked out"" is that Trump is actually referring to *negotiations and agreement over the price.*

Obviously the implications here are catastrophic; an embittered former president stealing our country's nuclear secrets for the purposes of personal enrichment. I haven't seen this theory floated anywhere, and yet, it's the only explanation I can fathom for why Trump would say such a thing. So I would really like to hear other possible explanations for Trump saying this that I'm overlooking.","changemyview",140,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17rx0ne/cmv_when_trump_told_hannity_do_you_know_that_they/"

Now the radical right has changed its tune, they voted down the bill because it was non-partisan and may shine the Democrats in a favorable light.

This time they have said it out loud, the border isn't an issue they care about, America's security isn't an issue they care about, immigration isn't an issue they care about except to make political points.

"" Lankford Says Major Conservative Media Figure Threatened Him Before Details of His Border Bill Were Public

Sen. **James Lankford** (R-OK) claimed that a conservative media figure threatened him prior to the details of his bipartisan border deal were even made public.

Lankford along with Sens. **Chris Murphy** (D-CT), and **Kyrsten Sinema** (I-AZ) worked for months to craft a bipartisan deal that would expand security funding at the border as well as provide billions to Ukraine, Israel, and other allies in the Indo-Pacific.

However, the deal received massive pushback from former President **Donald Trump** who pressured House Speaker **Mike Johnson** (R-LA) to kill the bill.

The Oklahoma senator took to the Senate floor on Wednesday to reveal that he too received major pushback behind the scenes from pundits in conservative media shortly before the bills text was released. Lankford then revealed that an unnamed conservative commentator *threatened to destroy* *him* if he helped *solve the border crisis* amid the 2024 presidential election.

I had a popular commentator four weeks ago that I talked to you, that told me flat out, before they knew any of the contents of the bill, any of the content, said Lankford. Nothing was out at that point. That told me flat out, If you try to move a bill that solves the border crisis during this presidential year, I will do whatever I can to destroy you, because I *do not want you to solve this during the presidential election.'*

By the way, they have been faithful to their promise and have done everything they can to destroy me in the past several weeks, the lawmaker added.

The recent influx of migrants at the border and the surge of undocumented border crossings has benefitted Trump in polling against President **Joe Biden** for the general election.

"2024-02-08",1707362106,"CMV: The most important near term goals for the American Left should be campaign finance and electoral reforms","And that includes working with the Democratic party **only until** we have achieved the systemic reforms necessary for more than two parties to compete in America.

By American Left Im referring to American left of capitalism.

This isnt an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the lefts political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Lets put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

If you think there are higher priority policy goals for the American Left, what are they and why?","changemyview",138,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1allv84/cmv_the_most_important_near_term_goals_for_the/"

This is a starting point, a snapshot in time. As the year progresses, I will be adding more longitudinal data and creating an online Governance Dashboard. If anyone has any studies like this, please share. It seems like I'm the only one doing a study like this.


I have more variables than this already pulled, but I feel as though, these variables give the best picture of performance. All of the variables shown are, at minimum, highly moderately correlated with each another.


How do i define political control?:

I look at the Governor and State Senate &amp; State House majority to determine which party is in control. To be fully Democratic or Republican controlled, the Governor, State Senate, and State House all must be one party otherwise, I categorize the state as Mixed control.

"2023-08-23",1692780029,"CMV: A lot of debates fail not because of the underlying topic, but because we forgot how to debate respectfully.","I want to build my view on a few arguments:

1.) Terminology: Even though a lot of people claim wanting to have debates/discussions, but forget that a discussion or debate is primarily about exchanging arguments, not convincing the other person. For example: if a claim to have a debate about a topic and I represent opinion a and my partner represents opinion b, the goal of a discussion is to understand the other person's point of view not forcing my opinion on them.

2.) Complexity: Pretty straight forward,it is unrealistic for a single person to have the perfect solution, thinking someone has the absolute truth not only is a daring assumption  it also forbids to have respect for other people's opinions, as I am ""holding the absolute truth""

3.) Targeting: also pretty forward, this one is less about the topic of the discussion, but about the way a lot of public debates are executed. A respectful discussion should always be about the topic, not the person. Even if you as a person are an absolute bozo, when entering a discussion, the only thing relevant are your arguments. Sentences like "" you people .."",  "" you always want..."" are neither helpful nor respectful.

Edit: I am referring to debates in a larger context, like talkshows, TV etc. Not like ones in this forum which ,to be fair, is a hood example for a good debatw culture.


Please note that English is not my first language, I tried my best writing understandably, though I cannot guarantee that I made no grammatical errors.

I would love to hear you arguments, as I am pretty sure I missed some points that oppose my view.","changemyview",127,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15yxuce/cmv_a_lot_of_debates_fail_not_because_of_the/"

Ive been doing other things.

This immediately caught the eye of New York Times correspondent Maggie Haberman, who responded by telling CNN that its notable that Trump threw his own son Eric to the wolves by making Eric the front person in the context of this lawsuit and fingering his son as the responsible party in the Trump Organizations fraud.  

So there you have it, folks. Trump has finally reached the point where he is throwing his own children  who have been his most loyal supporters  to the wolves in order to save his own skin. 

What a fitting and pathetic ending to Trumps criminal family enterprise.

In class a few days ago, we were doing a group workshops on what we could improve on our paper. One of the people that was in the group happened to be advocating for gun control. 

I jumped at the chance to have a discussion with someone who believed in stricter gun control is the key. He was saying things like we need to ban what he called military-style guns and we need universal background checks. I asked him to define what that meant like an full-auto M16, and he didnt have a clue. Then I mentioned the AR-15, and he brightened up. I had to explain then that AR-15 was semi-auto only whereas its military counterpart had full auto capabilities. I had to explain the difference between a machine gun and a semi-auto gun

On the issue of background checks, I explained that all gun sales through a licensed gun dealer require you to fill out ATF Form 4473 and undergo a background check before getting your gun. On private face-to-face sales, I acknowledged that on the federal level you didnt need a background check but you couldnt knowingly sell a gun to a prohibited person. 

This person was totally ignorant on the subject of firearms, yet he was advocating for gun laws knowing nothing on the matter. It made me kind of sad because these are the types of people that anti-gun politicians get their votes from. This is why Im an advocate for firearms education within our schools.

#Mississippi

*The Republican-controlled Mississippi legislature passed legislation last week that creates a separate unelected court system and expands Capitol Police authority in Jackson.*

###Unelected judges

[House Bill 1020](https://legiscan.com/MS/text/HB1020/id/2691819/Mississippi-2023-HB1020-Engrossed.html) would allow white, statewide officials to appoint their own judges to a new criminal justice court in Americas second Blackest city. Specifically, the bill tasks Mississippi Supreme Court Chief Justice Michael Randolpha staunch conservativewith staffing the new court (called the Capitol Complex Improvement District or CCID), as well as with picking five judges to serve alongside the four elected judges already on the Hinds County Circuit Court bench. The states white attorney general, Lynn Fitchwho [argued](https://www.mississippifreepress.org/30289/mississippi-purged-any-taint-from-jim-crow-law-by-1968-ag-fitch-tells-supreme-court) that Mississippi had purged any taint of racism from the states Jim Crow-era voting lawswould be responsible for appointing prosecutors to serve in the CCID.

&gt;Rep. Christopher Bell, D-Jackson, [said](https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2023/03/31/mississippi-legislature-passes-controversial-hb-1020-jackson-ms-courts-bill/70063431007/) the bill would effectively create a city within a city.

&gt;""The next thing I see coming out of this legislation, 1020, if it passes, is that will they start now to next year introduce a city council for the capital city complex and a city manager for the capitol city complex? Is that next? Is it needed?"" Bell said&

&gt;Johnson particularly spoke against an aspect of the bill that would allow the CCID inferior court, which would only try misdemeanors and preliminary aspects of felony cases, to send convicted individuals to prisons run by the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Municipal courts, which the CCID court has been compared to in scope, send those convicted of misdemeanors to local jails&Johnson said that whether someone ends up in prison for a minor offense could be decided by racial biases within the judicial system, particularly since the judge hearing the case would not be elected.

&gt;""The reason it bothers me so much (is) because I know how selective jurors can be, jurists can be, and see I'm Black,"" Johnson said. ""I know y'all can see that. And there's a jurist, there's a judge in this city, that may be appointed by a CCID court, that would look at me and say, 'Maybe you need a night in prison.'""

Rep. Edward Blackmon, D-Canton, spoke against the bill, [pointing out](https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/08/ms-bill-creates-separate-unelected-court-system-within-jackson-district-decried-as-racist/69883227007/) that concerns about crime are being used to justify a white conservative takeover of an 82% Black city:

&gt;""Only in Mississippi would we have a bill like this, with our history, where you say solving the problem is taking the vote away from Black people because we don't know how to choose our leaders. That's the problem. And the Trojan Horse that has been brought forward in this bill is called crime,"" Blackmon said. ""I'm old enough to know and understand that the right to vote has not always been ours, and perhaps I'm a little more sensitive to the idea that that vote can be taken away.""

###Expanding police

An accompanying bill also passed Friday would expand the authority of the Capitol Police, typically limited to state government buildings, to patrol and make arrests throughout the entire city. [Senate Bill 2343](https://legiscan.com/MS/text/SB2343/id/2694248/Mississippi-2023-SB2343-Engrossed.html) would essentially impose a double-policing regime on Jackson, giving Capitol Policea state-backed entity with no accountability to the citys residents and no oversight boardfree reign alongside the Jackson Police Department.

&gt;Rep. Zakiya Summers, D-Jackson, [said](https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2023/03/31/mississippi-legislature-passes-controversial-hb-1020-jackson-ms-courts-bill/70063431007/) her white colleagues cannot understand the fear that Black parents have for their children interacting with police. She has three young sons, Marvin, Mavis and Mathis.

&gt;""I don't know if you really understand what police do to Black communities,"" Summers said. ""When you go home from this body and lay in your bed at night, I want Marvin, Mavis and Mathis to be on your mind.""

&gt;Summers also said that the bill defies traditional conservative principles like limited government and spending.

&gt;""This is about spending millions of dollars to create a police state,"" Summers said. ""When we tell you that there are going to be negative racial consequences in terms of policy, why don't you believe us?""

Rep. Summers concerns arent unfounded. The Capitol Police have [shot](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/mississippi-capitol-police-shootings-use-force-policy-rcna72802) at least four people in Jackson since last year. 

&gt;In one of them, a 25-year-old father of two was shot in the head during what police described as a response to a traffic violation. In another, a 49-year-old woman was struck in the arm by an officers bullet during a chase that police say began with officers attempts to pull over a suspected stolen car. Citing pending investigations, the agency has released no information that explains how or why most of the shootings occurred, leaving the public and families of those who were injured or killed largely in the dark. 

&gt;The Mississippi Capitol Police does not require its officers to wear body cameras, a standard piece of equipment for American law enforcement that allows deeper understanding of officers use of force. ([Department of Public Safety Commissioner Sean] Tindell has said the agency requested the budget to buy cameras but has not received funding.) The department also operates outside of the citys control, answering to Tindell, who was appointed by the governor.  

Capitol Police Chief Bo Luckey blames citizens for the officer-involved shootings. We have had a spike in this area of officer-involved shootings, he [said](https://www.wlbt.com/2023/01/19/analysis-capitol-police-outpaces-other-agencies-across-state-after-four-officer-involved-shootings-five-months/). But I attribute that to that portion of the community, which is a very small portion, thats just not used to being proactively policed.

#Tennessee

*The Republican-controlled Tennessee legislature passed a bill last month to cut the size of Nashville Metro Council in half, hindering the citys ability to govern itself. Now, the conservative majority is moving to expel three Democratic lawmakers for supporting gun control protesters.*

###Nashville

[House Bill 48](https://legiscan.com/TN/text/HB0048/id/2757055/Tennessee-2023-HB0048-Chaptered.pdf), which passed the state House and Senate along party lines, caps all metropolitan legislative bodies in the state at 20 members. Though the language doesnt specifically mention Nashville, it is the only council that has more than 20 members. As a result, Nashvilles 40 elected representatives were cut in half when Republican Gov. Bill Lee signed the bill into law on March 9.

The Metro Council is a [diverse body](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/tennessee/articles/2023-03-09/tennessee-governor-oks-bill-to-cut-nashville-council-in-half): a quarter of the councils seats are held by Black members, half are held by women and five identify as LGBTQ.

&gt;This will set us back decades, said Democratic Sen Charlane Oliver, a Black lawmaker from Nashville. This will disproportionately impact the Black representation, the minority representation and dilute  not just dilute  it will steal and silence our voices.


Republican lawmakers pushed forward with the bill despite warnings that it violates the state constitution:

&gt;Metro Nashville Law Director Wally Dietz [said](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2023/03/09/tennessee-general-assembly-passes-bill-to-slash-nashville-council/69986567007/) the bills as passed ""contain several serious legal defects which will make them impossible to legally implement"" in a statement following Thursday's vote.

&gt;Dietz reiterated concerns shared by Nashville Mayor John Cooper in a letter to state leaders Monday: There is not enough time to transition to 20 or fewer council districts before Nashville's Aug. 3 election, and key portions of the bills violate the state constitution. Both issues would mire the city in significant legal risks, Cooper and Dietz stated, but attempts to point out legal defects to the legislature and state leaders have been ""largely ignored.""

&gt;""The inevitable result of the council bill will be deep uncertainty that is bad for government and bad for business,"" Cooper wrote in the letter obtained by The Tennessean&

&gt;The bill is widely viewed as the General Assembly's retaliation against the 40-member Metro Council after it blocked an effort for Nashville to bid on hosting the 2024 Republican National Convention, a move that sparked significant ire among legislative Republicans.

House Bill 48 also directly overrides the will of Nashville residents as expressed in a [2015 referendum](https://ballotpedia.org/Nashville-Davidson_Metro_Council_Member_Reduction_and_Term_Limit_Extension_Ballot_Initiative,_Amendment_2_\(August_2015\)) in which they overwhelmingly voted to maintain the size of the Metro Council.

Meanwhile, Republican bills advancing through the legislature would also [eliminate funding](https://www.newschannel5.com/news/tennessee-legislature-hopes-to-pull-the-funding-district-for-nashvilles-convention-center) for Nashvilles convention center and [remove](https://www.axios.com/local/nashville/2023/04/03/faa-metro-legal-concerned-about-state-taking-over-airport-authority) Nashvilles authority to govern its own airport.

*It is worth noting, too, that Republican lawmakers already [gerrymandered](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2022/jan/25/nashville-tennessee-gerrymandering-congress-republicans) the congressional map to split Democratic Nashville into three reliably Republican districts, eliminating the citys chosen Democratic representative. The previous 5th district was carried by President Joe Biden by 24 points; the new 5th district would have been won by Donald Trump by 12 points in 2020. Furthermore, the new district breaks up Black voters, diluting their votes by including more rural, white voters.*

###Expelling lawmakers

Three Democratic lawmakers in Tennessee were stripped of their campaign assignments and are now on the verge of being expelled from the state House for joining protests against gun violence.

Thousands of parents and students traveled to the state capitol building on Thursday to demand stronger gun control following the school shooting at Covenant School that left three children and three adults dead. The protesters loudly but peacefully [confronted](https://youtu.be/nkJHC63a9As?t=124) lawmakers as they arrived at the building. 

Later in the legislative session, Reps. Justin Jones (Nashville), Justin J. Pearson (Memphis), and Gloria Johnson (Knoxville) approached the podium without being recognized to speak and, using a bullhorn, led protesters in the galleries in several chants calling for gun reform. 

House Speaker Cameron Sexton (R-Crossville) immediately recessed the chamber and ordered security to clear the House galleries. He later [compared](https://www.wsmv.com/2023/04/04/speaker-sexton-compares-gun-protest-january-6-insurrection-draws-backlash/) the three Democratic lawmakers actions to the January 6th insurrection:

&gt;Two of the members, Representative Jones and Representative Johnson, have been very vocal about January 6 in Washington D.C., about what that was, and what they did today was equivalent, at least equivalent, maybe worse depending on how you look at it, of doing an insurrection in the capitol.

A final vote to expel the members will occur today. The three lawmakers represent Tennessees three most populous cities and the two bluest areas in the state.

*Note that former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada (R) was [charged](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/tennessee-state-representative-and-former-chief-staff-charged-bribery-and-kickback-conspiracy) with bribery, fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering yet the Republican majority did not expel him from the legislature.*

#Texas

*Texas Republican lawmakers are considering bills to strip the states most populous blue county, Harris County, of its rights to run its own elections. At the same time, state officials are taking over Texass largest school district in Houston, which also happens to be attended by a large Black and Hispanic population.*

###Seizing control of elections

[Senate Bill 1750](https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB1750/id/2730762/Texas-2023-SB1750-Introduced.html), introduced by Harris County Republican Sen. Paul Bettencourt, would abolish the office of elections administrator in all populous Texas counties (over 1 million people), transferring the responsibility to the county tax assessor-collector and county clerk.

&gt;[Texas Southern University Professor Michael] Adams [said](https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/politics/2023/03/08/445650/bettencourt-cain-and-schofield-seek-to-abolish-harris-county-election-administrators-office/) that, when it comes to large counties, if often makes more sense to have a full-time, appointed official overseeing elections rather than having the functions split between two elected officials who have multiple other duties.

&gt;""I think this is just a partisan food fight between the two parties in terms of it's targeted at Harris County,"" Adams said, ""and it's all part and parcel of what we've seen in terms of what the Republicans are saying now, that their votes are being suppressed based on things that happened within the Election Administrator's Office.""

[Senate Bill 823](https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB823/id/2692770/Texas-2023-SB823-Introduced.html), also introduced by Bettencourt, would give the Republican secretary of state the power to suspend a county elections administrator if, during an election, voting system equipment malfunctions or election results are delayed. The secretary of state can then appoint their own elections administrator.

&gt;[The League of Women Voters of Texas](https://lwvtexas.org/content.aspx?page_id=5&amp;club_id=979482&amp;item_id=85299&amp;#gsc.tab=0):""There are growing concerns in the voting rights community that the State will use these election challenges as an excuse to advance bills filed that would allow the Secretary of State to take over certain county elections where there may be a minimal finding of problems, and in particular in Harris County. Such legislation, if passed, is fraught for potential abuse, infringes on the rights of county governments to select their own elections administrator, and demeans the meaning of local governance.

&gt;The Harris County voters have spoken in the 2022 election, and the election results have been certified. It is time for politicians to respect the election results and to work with County Election Administrators to have the resources they need to run effective, efficient, accessible, and fair elections.

[Senate Bill 1993](https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB1993/id/2734668/Texas-2023-SB1993-Introduced.html), introduced by Galveston Republican Sen. Mayes Middleton, would grant the Republican secretary of state the authority to order a new election in Harris County (or any of the four other large Texas counties) if the secretary has good cause to believe that at least two percent of the total number of polling places in the county did not receive supplemental ballots. 

&gt;The bill would allow really low thresholds for ordering a new election, Katya Ehresman, the voting rights program manager at Common Cause Texas, told [TPM](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/texas-gop-proposes-bill-to-allow-sec-of-state-to-overturn-election-results-in-states-largest-blue-county).  Anything from a machine malfunction, which can necessarily be the fault of the county or of an election administrator getting stuck in trafficwhich in Houston is incredibly likelyand having a delay in providing election results to the central count station, she said&A lot of what we see is Harris County as an example of a need to invest in election administration and not penalize or detract from it, Ehresman said.

Despite not naming Harris County, home to Houston, specifically, all three bills target the Democratic stronghold on the [false pretense](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/12/19/texas-elections-2020-audit-john-scott-secretary-state/) that it was ground zero for voter fraud in the 2020 election. 

###School district takeover

Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's administration announced last month that it will take over the Houston Independent School District (HISD), ousting its superintendent and the elected board of trustees. Education commissioner Mike Morath, chosen by Abbott, will have the ability to appoint his own officials to the positions.

Abbott and Morath justify the move by citing the districts past poor performance, but discount its recent improvements. The single high school, Phillis Wheatley High, that Morath uses as an example of the failing district raised its grade to a passing C last year. It is no mystery why Wheatley struggled with reaching the states performance metrics; it is chronically underfunded (as are [most schools](https://apnews.com/article/houston-schools-texas-takeover-eae680bec5fbd3b419c2583fb850d42e?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_06) in Texas) and serves an [impoverished](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/texas/districts/houston-independent-school-district/wheatley-high-school-19252) populace. 96% of Wheatley students financially qualify for a free lunch program. The student body also happens to be nearly entirely Black and Hispanic.

According to the [Texas Tribune](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/03/15/texas-education-houston-isd-takeover/?utm_campaign=trib-social&amp;utm_content=1678895228&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter), 94% of schools in the state's largest school district were given an A, B, or C grade last year, while HISD as a whole earned a B.

&gt;The takeover should be a concern for superintendents around the state, especially those in large urban districts, [said](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/03/16/texas-education-agency-houston-school-district-takeover/11484474002/) David DeMatthews, associate professor the University of Texas Department of Educational Leadership and Policy&If HISD has made improvements, the state should be backing away right now and it's doing the opposite, DeMatthews said&.

&gt;Democratic lawmakers worry the takeover could have implications for other Texas school districts, especially those in large urban areas. And some cast it as part of a push by conservative Republicans to remake education across the country.

&gt;Its a national movement, said state Rep. Alma Allen, a Democrat who represents a swath of southern Houston and is vice chairwoman of the House Public Education committee. The Republicans are planning to take over education in the United States. [...]

&gt;Were really very pissed off, quite frankly, said Rep. Ron Reynolds, a Democrat and chairman of the Texas Legislative Black Caucus. Enough is enough.

&gt;Reynolds is worried the takeover will mean less representation for students of color in Houston, he said.

&gt;This is an upfront power grab, Reynolds said. This is an attempt to push vouchers, to promote and push the things Gov. Abbott cares about.","Keep_Track",112,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/12dlyzr/republicans_advance_bills_to_take_over_democratic/"

While I'm against this legislation for many reasons (such as the fact that it is being used explicitly to prevent abortion legislation), the idea that an amendment requiring 60% of the vote could pass with 50.1% of the vote seems extra absurd. I'm not fully against the idea that constitutional amendments should have a high bar to clear (as is the case for federal amendments to the Constitution), but it seems hypocritical to extol the benefits of such a high barrier while using the 50% threshold to accomplish your ends.","changemyview",110,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14s5s1j/cmv_ohios_question_1_should_be_required_to_obtain/"

"2023-06-23",1687482243,"CMV: Governments should force corporation to produce durable/ repairable products.","Capitalism is a fantastic system for addressing supply and demand. It can determine what people want, place a value on that desire, and provide it to people. 

Though, capitalism has many shortcomings. And, these shortcomings can often only be addressed through government regulation. Capitalism was responsible for destroying the ozone layer with CFCs. Governments across the world united to regulate this chemical and remove it from production. As a result, the ozone is healing. CFCs were a cheap, effective manufacturing material, so there was significant demand. Capitalism provided for that demand. Regulation ended the demand. 

A similar problem exists within capitalism today. There are certain materials that are extremely popular because they are cheap and effective (i.e plastics, cheap clothing fabrics, cheap furniture, cheap appliances). Yes, in the short term, these products are cheaper. But in the long term, consumers end up spending more money due to the poor quality of these materials. 

Additionally, businesses have a vested interest to manufacture products that dont last. I read recently that InstantPot is going bankrupt, because they realized people only need to buy their product once every 10-15 years, so they desperately tried making other products and overextended. If they originally designed their flagship product to last 3-5 years, the company would be thriving today. 

Further, products are designed to be impossible to repair by the common consumer. Decades ago, products such as washing machines, fridges, etc. used to use common components. If your machine broke, you could go to the hardware store, buy a component, and repair it. Nowadays, these machines use cheap components, only available through the manufacturer. You cant even change the battery on certain cars these days without going to a dealership, where they use a special tool mailed to them by the manufacturer. 

I know Im droning on, but theres simply so many points to this. Cheap materials and products that cannot be repaired create a substantial amount of waste. Plastic packaging, synthetic clothes from Walmart, cheap ikea furniture, and laundry machines that are designed to last 5 years all create waste than cannot be reused. This is a cost to society that will eventually have to be paid, through cleanup efforts or ecological disaster. 


This flaw of capitalism causes massive problems. And, Im not arguing that this is necessarily malicious. There is simply a high demand for cheap materials and capitalism provides for this demand. But in the long term, it is more resource efficient, cheaper for the consumer, and better for the environment to produce durable, reusable, repairable products. 

Governments must pursue regulation that increases the demand for durable products and decreases demand for cheap, low quality products.



Edit:

These comments have allowed me to think about my position further. Lots of people are asking how the government would be able to do this. Im sure there are many solutions, but here are a few I have thought of. 

Create a tax similar to sales tax that incorporates product waste per year. If a product lasted fives years, its product waste per year would be much lower than a product that lasts one year. Because this is a point of sale tax, it would include both domestic and foreign companies. 

Give businesses tax breaks for using reusable materials.

He has been doing that since Richard Nixon was president in the 1970s and he is one of Donald Trump's greatest allies (pardoned of crimes he was convicted of in Trump's last weeks in office).

Democrats need to know what they are up against in the 2024 election. The republicans are out there pulling every trick in the book. Their favorite thing right now is to get the states to impose voter suppression actions. And they are making great strides in that regard.

"2023-11-16",1700142682,"CMV: In a politician, competence is at least as important as values. Voters tend to place way too little priority towards competence versus values, when it comes to choosing a candidate","I think that competence and values are two very important things a voter must take into consideration.

Values are important because, if a policy maker gets elected, and their values differ strongly from yours, they are less likely to look for outcomes, when implementing policies, that are aligned with the outcomes that you value, than a politician whose values are more strongly aligned with yours

On the other hand, competence speaks to a politician's ability to find the right policies, and manage their office the right way, to generate those outcomes whose values are aligned with yours.

Therefore, you have two major considerations. You want a politician to seek outcomes whose values align with yours, and you want the politician to be able to effectively bring about those outcomes. That is, you want value alignment, and competence.

I think voters overestimate the degree to which their values are different from certain candidates, and underestimate the difference in candidates' ability to effect outcomes that they value.

When it comes to values of candidates, the differences usually manifest in the polarized issues. However, when it comes to office management and policy making, a minority of the effort that politicians strive towards are the partisan issues. Politicians spend a lot more time and effort trying to work towards the values on which most people agree-providing rewarding and meaningful work to the constituents, making sure nobody starves or is homeless, increasing the state's innovation and other states' desire to purchase from them, keeping the constituents safe and prosperous--than they spend on the values on which people are divided--handling people's level of privacy versus security, bodily autonomy, rights to dangerous or self-harming activities, or equity of outcome along certain demographic characteristics. This is an important thing that is obscured by the availability heuristic. The divisive subjects get the most press, because it's the one that causes candidates to vigorously debate against each other, rather than just circle jerk about how much they agree.

To be clear about a point above, I am separating between *values* that are shared among all candidates, versus those on which candidates are split. I'm not referring to *policies* that are consensus versus partisan. The difference is important. Policies on which candidates disagree may not reflect values on which they disagree, but rather, disagreement of the empirical fact of a policy's ability to effect outcomes on whose values the candidates both agree. For example, all candidates probably want their constituents to be prosperous and not fall into homelessness. However, they may disagree about a specific economic policy, such as raising minimum wage. The disagreement on minimum wage usually stems from disagreement about the empirical fact of whether it will make the constituents more prosperous or less. Advocates would argue that it directly raises the pay employees gain, and makes it easier for them to live. Detractors would argue that it would exacerbate inflation, and reduce the supply of job postings, ultimately doing more harm than good to people on the low end of wages.

The distinction between value disagreement, and disagreement on a policy's ability to bring about a value, is an important one. This is because the latter is more of a reflection of competence than values of a candidate. If two candidates share the same value, but disagree on policies, the candidate who is more knowledgeable about the domain (e.g. economics) is more likely to pick the policies that more effectively bring those values than those picked by the less knowledgeable candidate.

In practice, it's hard to know how to weigh values and competence against each other when choosing a candidate. However, you can get certain easy cases.

Suppose you have two candidates, both of whom are very well accomplished, show incredible ability to effect positive change from their career, and candidate A is slightly more competent than candidate B, but A's values are anathema to you, whereas B's values are strongly aligned with yours. In that case you should choose B.

On the other hand, suppose candidate A is a failed drama teacher with no experience in politics, and is only a candidate due to nepotism, but strongly aligns with your values, whereas candidate B is a Nobel Prize winning Economist with 15 years of experience in political office and a strong track record for implementing effective policies, but their values aren't quite as strongly aligned with yours, and they disagree with you on several of the (fringe) partisan issues. I would argue that candidate B is the superior choice. Yet I find that, in this situation, almost everyone would choose candidate A because people put too much weight to value alignment over competence.

EDIT: I want to clarify something, because a lot of people are misreading my second last paragraph (above) and making the point, which does not at all conflict with my argument, that if a candidate is against your values but more competent, you shouldn't vote for them because they will competently enact outcomes that you don't value. Yes, I agree with this idea, but you're not reading what I said carefully. In the example I gave, candidate B's values align with yours *slightly less than* A's, they're not ""against your values"", as some has put. To re-iterate the point of that paragraph, I'm saying that the two are hard to weigh against each other, but the extreme cases make the choice easy. If competence is similar and value alignment is extremely different, vote for the more value-aligned one. If value-alignment is only slightly different and competence is extremely different, then vote for the more competent one. (That is, unless, they're both misaligned with your values. But I think that this is almost never the case, because, as I said earlier, most people value the same things, and disproportionate attention is only given to the issues where people strongly disagree.)","changemyview",91,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17wnczy/cmv_in_a_politician_competence_is_at_least_as/"

This creates an unhealthy hivemind mentality where people pile on downvotes once a comment already has a negative score. Shouldn't it display both?

Seeing only the net score makes a -100 comment look like everyone disagrees, even though the real counts could be 11,000 upvotes and 11,100 downvotes. That's still a very mixed opinion overall!

Only showing net scores makes people scared to share minority opinions, since they'll assume no one agrees if the visible score is negative. This strengthens echo chambers and discourages healthy debate.

Reddit should show both upvote and downvote counts, or at least show the ratio of upvote %.That would give a much more nuanced look at public opinion.

For example, a score of -20 with a ratio of 45% would indicate a very divisive comment that some agree with. But the way it looks now, -20 appears like overwhelming disagreement.

Showing both numbers would lead to less pile-on downvoting and more reasoned discussion. People would be more willing to express minority opinions knowing others agree. And seeing the upvote count might make some reconsider a downvote.

Reddit already tracks both numbers internally.Making them visible would be an easy change to reduce hivemind mentality and echo chambers. The resulting discussions would be more representative of variety in public opinion, not just the majority viewpoint.

Rep. Mike Johnson (R), representing Louisianas 4th District (Shreveport-Bossier City), was unanimously elected Speaker of the House by all 220 Republicans present yesterday. He is a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus and sits on the House Judiciary Committee and Armed Services Committee.

###DEMOCRACY

If you need to know one thing about Johnson, it is that he played a central role in crafting the legal reasoning to overturn the 2020 election. As a former constitutional lawyer, Johnson was able to provide legitimate-sounding talking points for Republicans to support Trump, hiding the fact that what they were actually doing was undermining democracy and igniting an insurrection. 

&gt;[NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/25/us/politics/mike-johnson-2020-election-overturn.html): In December 2020, Mr. Johnson collected signatures for a legal brief in support of a Texas lawsuit, rooted in baseless claims of widespread election irregularities, that tried to throw out the results in four battleground states won by Joseph R. Biden Jr. The Supreme Court ultimately rejected the suit, but not before Mr. Johnson persuaded more than 60 percent of House Republicans to sign onto the effort. 

&gt;[NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/03/us/politics/republican-election-objectors.html): Two-thirds of [House Republicans]  139 in all  had been voting on Jan. 6, 2021, to dispute the Electoral College count that would seal Donald J. Trumps defeat just as rioters determined to keep the president in power stormed the chamber& In formal statements justifying their votes, about three-quarters relied on the arguments of a low-profile Louisiana congressman, Representative Mike Johnson, the most important architect of the Electoral College objections.

&gt;On the eve of the Jan. 6 votes, he presented colleagues with what he called a third option. He faulted the way some states had changed voting procedures during the pandemic, saying it was unconstitutional, without supporting the outlandish claims of Mr. Trumps most vocal supporters. His Republican critics called it a Trojan horse that allowed lawmakers to vote with the president while hiding behind a more defensible case.

Johnson not only [voted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition_Caucus) to overturn the 2020 election, he also [voted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/05/19/jan-6-commission-vote/) against establishing the select committee to investigate the January 6th insurrection.

###ABORTION

Before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2016, Johnson worked as a lawyer representing Christian clients. He [described](https://www.baptistmessage.com/mike-johnson-faith-family-freedom-motivate-run-seat-u-s-congress/) his legal career as being on the front lines of the culture war defending religious freedom, the sanctity of human life, and biblical values, including the defense of traditional marriage, and other ideals like these when theyve been under assault.

Johnson has co-sponsored at least four bills that would enact national abortion bans: 

* [Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain-Capable_Unborn_Child_Protection_Act) would ban abortions at 20 weeks of pregnancy. Doctors who violate the law would be subject to up to 5 years in prison.

* [Protecting Pain-Capable Unborn Children From Late-Term Abortions Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8814/text) would ban abortions at 15 weeks of pregnancy. Doctors who violate the law would be subject to up to 5 years in prison.

* [Heartbeat Protection Act of 2021](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/705/text) would ban abortions at approximately 6 weeks of pregnancy. Doctors who violate the law would be subject to up to 5 years in prison.

* [Life at Conception Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/431?overview=closed) would ban all abortions, defining personhood as beginning at the moment of fertilization. As an unwritten consequence, this bill would also ban the morning after pill. 

Earlier this year, Johnson was the lead sponsor of a [bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/792?s=1&amp;r=6) that would make it a crime to transport a minor across state lines to obtain an abortion without parental notificationregardless of the parental notification laws in the medical offices jurisdiction.

Johnson also has a history of making radical anti-abortion statements:

After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and Louisiana [strengthened](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/louisiana-governor-signs-abortion-bills-imposing-criminal-penalties/story?id=85258010) its abortion trigger law, Johnson celebrated on Twitter, [saying](https://twitter.com/RepMikeJohnson/status/1616896170348974080?s=20), And now& FINALLY& because Roe v. Wade was overturned last summer and Louisiana is now a proudly pro-life state we will get the number of abortions to ZERO!! EVERYONE deserves a birthday. Thanks be to God.

During a House Judiciary Committee hearing, Johnson [attacked Roe v. Wade](https://x.com/HouseJudiciary/status/1717183190463336780?s=20), saying that if American women were producing more bodies to fuel the economy Republicans wouldnt have to cut essential social programs like Medicare and Medicaid.

&gt;Roe v. Wade gave constitutional cover to the elective killing of unborn children in America. Period. You think about the implications of that on the economy. Were all struggling here to cover the bases of Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid and all the rest. If we had all those able-bodied workers in the economy, we wouldnt be going upside down and toppling over like this.

###LGBTQ+ RIGHTS

Before winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives, Johnson worked as an attorney and spokesperson for Alliance Defending Freedom, which is designated a hate group by the Southern Law Poverty Center for its anti-LGBTQ+ campaigns. During his time with the organization, Johnson wrote an [op-ed](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-times-kfile/134020593/) arguing that Lawrence v. Texas, a Supreme Court case ruling that states cannot criminalize homosexual conduct, should be overturned. There is clearly no right to sodomy in the Constitution&by closing these bedroom doors, they have opened a Pandoras box, Johnson said.

Two years later, in 2005, Johnson [received](https://web.archive.org/web/20231025183250/https://www.christianpost.com/news/frc-presents-147-family-faith-and-freedom-award-148-to-adf-lawyer.html) the Family Research Councils Faith, Family, and Freedom Award for helping to push through Louisianas ban on same-sex marriage. While defending the amendment, Johnston [wrote](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-times-kfile/134019997/) that allowing same-sex marriage would lead to legal pedophilia and people marrying their pets.

Johnson brought this Christian extremist zeal into his work as a lawmaker, first at the state and then at the federal level.

* As a state legislator, Johnson introduced the [Marriage and Conscience Act](https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=937123.), which would have prevented the state of Louisiana from prosecuting anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination.

* As a U.S. representative, Johnson [authored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_the_Sexualization_of_Children_Act) the national Dont Say Gay bill (formally titled the Stop the Sexualization of Children Act) to strip funding from schools and organizations that teach children about gender identity, gender dysphoria, transgenderism, [or] sexual orientation. 

* Johnson co-sponsored Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greenes [Protect Childrens Innocence Act](https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1642916), which would prohibit gender-affirming care for minors.

* Johnson co-sponsored the [Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2023](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/734/text?s=8&amp;r=2&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22734%22%7D), which would ban transgender athletes from womens and girls sports at federally funded schools and educational institutions.","Keep_Track",85,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/17gtji5/house_republicans_elect_a_christian_extremist_as/"

"2023-12-13",1702442008,"CMV: The rise of ADHD diagnoses has much more to do with the rise of social media than it does advancements in modern psychology","I'd love to be proven wrong on this in a way I can genuinely believe, but as of now I feel very strongly about this.

There *is* the obvious argument that advancements in psychology have allowed us to diagnose mental illnesses that were left untreated and undiagnosed in the past. I'm not refuting this, but what I do refute is that being the root cause of why [ADHD diagnoses have tripled since 2010](https://epicresearch.org/articles/number-of-adhd-patients-rising-especially-among-women). It makes too much sense to me that dwindling attention spans and constant hits of dopamine received through engagement on social media are a root cause of the massive increase in ADHD diagnoses we see today. I see this as a frightening issue when one of the most common medications to treat this disorder is amphetamines, which is essentially legalized meth. The difference between 30mg of Adderall and 30mg of methamphetamine is not actually that much; meth addicts just don't take 30mg of the stuff in practice. I am worried for us as a society when we are so quick to treat this problem with a potentially even bigger problem, without having serious concern for the root cause of it. 

ADHD is a disorder characterized by a dopamine deficiency in the body, and we treat it with amphetamines because, like meth, it is a drug that causes your brain to release dopamine. Outside of tolerance it does not build up in your system, meaning if you miss one single dose, your symptoms that day will be much worse than if you never started taking amphetamines at all. I am not trying to imply that we should ban amphetamines for people with ADHD who benefit from it, but I feel strongly that we should treat it as the sharp double edged sword that it is, and question why it was taken from its sheath to begin with. Many children these days grow up with smart phones and tablets watching YouTube and other forms of social media that have been proven to be incredibly addictive, that is a known issue. What doesn't seem to be debated as much though is the potential this has to turn into permanent drug dependency problems later on in life. Again, I'd love to be proven wrong on this.","changemyview",81,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18h8mv9/cmv_the_rise_of_adhd_diagnoses_has_much_more_to/"

Me and my dad for example, are both politically centered, while I'm a bit more left leaning and he's a bit more right leaning. There are but a few topics we disagree on, but our social media feeds look the exact opposite. My feed is made up of mostly left wing and some times extreme left propaganda while his is mostly right wing with extreme right propaganda. We once even got to the conclusion that the same news article was reaching us at different points of discussion, as in, he gets the article on his feed raw and I only get the article after someone countered the arguments.

This gigantic difference for two individuals who share the majority of opinions has been making it extremely hard to debate with each other over the years because we see information through the algorithms' lense.

In addition, my mother who's out of the social media loop, sometimes doesn't even recognize the topics were talking about due to these topics only being discuted by a very small percentage of the population (social media users).

This distortion makes it seem that people who actually think a lot like you are miles away and that consensus is not possible.

On top of that, debates with other people I know are becoming more and more based around sound bites and whataboutism because that's all the algorithm feeds us.

I therefore believe that these algorithms are a serious threat to the way we are debating several critical topics and consequently a threat to the well-being of society.

I have no clue which solution could be implemented but I do believe that this is a pressing matter.","changemyview",71,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17mazys/cmv_current_social_media_algorithms_are_a_threat/"

North Carolina Republicans passed new, gerrymandered maps last month to ensure their party holds nearly all congressional seats and a veto-proof legislative majority. 

###Background

At a statewide level, North Carolina is one of the most purple in the nation. The 2020 election was decided by less than 100,000 votes, with Trump winning by just one percentage point. Although Republicans control both the Assembly and Senate, the state has had a Democratic governor and a Democratic Attorney General since 2017.  Gov. Roy Cooper (D), in fact, won his last election by over four percentage points.

Given that (active) state voters are split approximately 50/50 between the two major parties, it would follow that the states districts should provide the opportunity to elect 50% Republicans and 50% Democrats. Unfortunately, the GOP legislators in control of redistricting have shown time and time again that they would rather create a one-party state than have fair elections. 

After the 2020 census, North Carolina Republicans drew congressional maps that would have resulted in 10 solidly Republican districts, three solidly Democratic districts, and one competitive district. Voting rights groups sued, and the state Supreme Court [ruled](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/04/north-carolina-supreme-court-redistricting-maps) 4-3 in their favor, finding that the maps violated citizens rights to free elections, freedom of speech, and equal protections of citizens.

&gt;When, on the basis of partisanship, the general assembly enacts a districting plan that diminishes or dilutes a voters opportunity to aggregate with likeminded voters to elect a governing majority ... the general assembly unconstitutionally infringes upon that voters fundamental right to vote, read the order of the courts majority, signed by associate Justice Robin Hudson.

The courts [approved](https://www.wral.com/story/nc-supreme-court-ok-s-new-voting-maps-for-2022-election/20153515/) new maps in February 2022, including a congressional map drawn by bipartisan experts that resulted in seven Democratic and seven Republican districts.

Then came the 2022 election. The congressional map worked as intended, allowing voters to elect an equal number of Democrats and Republicans to the U.S. Congress. However, two Democratic Supreme Court justices [lost](https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2022/11/city-nc-supreme-court-2022-election-results) re-election, flipping the court to a 5-2 Republican majority. Republican legislators petitioned the Supreme Court to [redecide](https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-phil-berger-north-carolina-efd8e1beaadda6fac097c733e34eafb6) the earlier redistricting case as soon as the new justices were seated  and, as they hoped, the GOP majority [ruled](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/28/north-carolina-supreme-court-clears-way-for-partisan-gerrymandering-00094433) in their favor:

&gt;There is no judicially manageable standard by which to adjudicate partisan gerrymandering claims. Courts are not intended to meddle in policy matters, Chief Justice Paul Newby wrote in his 144-page opinion for the courts majority&

&gt;For a brief window in time, the power of deciding who is elected to office was given to the people, as required by the state constitution, Justice Anita Earls wrote in her 72-page dissent, joined by Justice Michael Morgan. The two, who joined the courts ruling last year striking down the map for being too partisan, are the last remaining Democratic jurists on the court.

&gt;Today, the majority strips the people of this right; it tells North Carolinians that the state constitution and the courts cannot protect their basic human right to self-governance and self-determination, Earls added, declaring that her Republican colleagues efforts to downplay the practice do not erase its consequences and the public will not be gaslighted.

###New maps

Without the court-imposed restraints of fairness and democracy dictating what lines they could draw, North Carolina Republicans passed new maps last month thatif allowed to standwill ensure their party never loses power.

The congressional map will give Republicans as many as 11 out of 14 seats while limiting Democrats to at most four of 14. In other words, Democrats could net the majority of the statewide vote but win less than 30% of congressional seats. Republicans, meanwhile, will always win at least 70% of the congressional seats no matter how poorly they perform statewide. 

According to Duke math professor [Jonathan Mattingly](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article280259464.html), the new maps essentially negate the need to have elections for the U.S. House of Representatives.

&gt;No matter how well Democrats perform, simulation after simulation shows almost no change in the makeup of the congressional delegation, reliably electing 10 or 11 Republicans compared to the current 7-7 party split.

Compare the court-approved [2022](https://imgur.com/x4cs9zx) congressional map (shaded by Bidens 2020 margins) with the [new](https://imgur.com/Si1C8Kq) congressional map. Democratic voters are packed into three urban districts (2nd, 4th, and 12th); all but one of the other districts that trended Democratic in the 2022 map are crackedsplit up and combined with enough Republican-voting areas to dilute Democratic votes. As a result, the districts of Democratic Reps. Kathy Manning (6th), Jeff Jackson (14th), and Wiley Nickel (13th) no longer exist. Rep. Don Daviss (D) 1st district is kept intact but drawn to include more white, Republican voters, making it harder to win.

In total, U.S. House Republicans are expected to gain at least 3 more congressional seats from North Carolina alone in the 2024 election.

The legislative maps adopted last month are no better, gerrymandering the GOP into a permanent supermajority in both the state Senate and Assembly. An analysis by Duke University [found](https://sites.duke.edu/quantifyinggerrymandering/2023/10/20/newly-proposed-nc-maps-are-more-gerrymandered-and-less-responsive-than-maps-struck-down-in-2021/) that in both chambers, the proposed plans are even more extreme than the originally enacted 2021 maps ruled unconstitutional by the then-Democratic state Supreme Court:

&gt;Both the Senate and House maps under-elect Democrats as one moves to more balanced elections with Republican statewide vote fractions near 50%. This has important implications for the preservation of the super-majority in the chamber.  Under the newly proposed Senate maps, the Republicans may reasonably expect to obtain a super majority, even when the statewide Democratic vote share is over 50%...

&gt;...the newly proposed [Assembly] map preserves the super-majority. In the more democratic-leaning elections, the ensemble and the remedial map from 2022 would typically give control of the chamber to the Democrats but the newly proposed map leaves the Republicans with a sizable majority.

###What can be done

There will almost certainly be legal challenges to the new maps. However, the state Supreme Court is unlikely to rule against Republican legislators because the new conservative majority greenlit their effort to replace 2022s fair maps in the first place.

Plaintiffs could also challenge the maps in the federal courts, but are limited by the 2019 U.S. Supreme Court [ruling](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-422_9ol1.pdf) that partisan gerrymandering claims present political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts. That means that parties are barred from arguing that Republicans drew the new districts to give themselves an unfair advantage over Democrats. Instead, plaintiffs must make the case that the legislature [either](https://www.democracydocket.com/analysis/racial-gerrymandering-vs-racial-vote-dilution-explained/) used race as the predominant factor to determine district lines (violating the U.S. Constitution) or diluted the voting power of minority groups through cracking and packing districts (violating the Voting Rights Act).

Northeastern North Carolina, from Greenville to the Virginia border, has the highest percentage of Black residents in the state. It is currently represented by Rep. Don Davis, a Black Democrat, as part of the 1st District. The new map redraws the 1st to include more white, rural votersmaking it more difficult for Black voters to elect a candidate of their choice.

The Piedmont Triad, made up of Greensboro, Winston-Salem, and High Point, is another area that could be used to demonstrate racial gerrymandering. Whereas the 2022 map kept the region intact as the 6th District, the new map divides Black communities between three different districts that sprawl across the state ([see map](https://imgur.com/pZTr53W)) to include more white, rural voters.

Republican legislators insist that they did not consider race when drawing the new maps. This itself is a problem because race must be analyzed to ensure that the votes of racial minorities arent illegally diluted. As Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in [Allen v. Mulligan](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1086_1co6.pdf), a 2022 ruling that Alabamas maps were racially gerrymandered, [Section 2](https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act) of the Voting Rights Act demands consideration of race. 

However, proving if race was taken into account, and for what purposes, will be difficult given that Republicans inserted a [provision](https://web.archive.org/web/20231005173611/https:/www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article279598614.html) into the state budget that removes redistricting drafts and communications from the public recordallowing legislators to shield their decision-making process from legal scrutiny.

&gt;A provision in the newly released state budget appears to remove all communications regarding redistricting from the public record.

&gt;Current state law says that once new maps are approved, most of the drafting and communication that led up to those maps becomes public records that anyone can request.

&gt;The budget, however, completely repeals that section of state law.","Keep_Track",70,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/17p7oks/north_carolina_republicans_gerrymander_themselves/"

Brian Pritchard, the first vice-president of the state Republican party, illegally voted in nine elections from 2008 to 2010 while he was still on probation for a 1996 forgery felony conviction in Pennsylvania. Georgia and 14 other states require people to have completed their sentence, including probation, before they can vote. About 163,475 people could not vote in Georgia in 2022 because they were on felony probation, according to an estimate by the Sentencing Project, a criminal justice non-profit.*

Our lovely one vote supermajority in the legislature , overrode Gov Coopers veto and changed the rules this cycle in their token election integrity package. The one vote supermajority comes from a Democratic Charlotte representative Tricia Cotham changing her party to R.

-The Vote by Mail envelope incorrectly states that you may mail your ballot so that it is postmarked by Election Day. This is wrong. Your ballot must now arrive by polls close on Election Day. Did they send this out knowing the information on the envelope would confuse voters? 
-Vote my Mail ballots no longer include prepaid postage. Instead of just dropping my ballot off at the mailbox (like I did last year!) I went to CVS to get stamps and spent $13.60 on a forever stamp book cause you cant get single stamps there? We need 3 on our ballot. Cant believe Im seriously having to pay to vote. 
-Voter ID is now required. A photocopy of your ID is now required in the ballot. I do not have a photocopier in my dorm room, horray! I filled out the ID exception form, providing my drivers license # as alternative verification.
-The ballot also requires 2 witnesses to sign and provide their addresses, or, you can have it notarized! Good thing I have two roommates. 

Please spread the word that Mark Robinson cannot be elected Gov of NC! He wants to ban abortion statewide, implement further voting restrictions and has called the LGBTQ community quote filth, which doesnt even scratch the surface. The man is nuts.

#The debt ceiling

[U.S. Treasury Department](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-markets-financial-institutions-and-fiscal-service/debt-limit):

&gt;The debt limit is the total amount of money that the United States government is authorized to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations, including Social Security and Medicare benefits, military salaries, interest on the national debt, tax refunds, and other payments.

&gt;The debt limit does not authorize new spending commitments. It simply allows the government to finance existing legal obligations that Congresses and presidents of both parties have made in the past.

&gt;Failing to increase the debt limit would have catastrophic economic consequences. It would cause the government to default on its legal obligations  an unprecedented event in American history. That would precipitate another financial crisis and threaten the jobs and savings of everyday Americans  putting the United States right back in a deep economic hole, just as the country is recovering from the recent recession.   

&gt;Congress has always acted when called upon to raise the debt limit. Since 1960, Congress has acted 78 separate times to permanently raise, temporarily extend, or revise the definition of the debt limit  49 times under Republican presidents and 29 times under Democratic presidents. Congressional leaders in both parties have recognized that this is necessary.

The Treasury Department has [said](https://www.axios.com/2023/05/22/yellen-debt-ceiling-deadline-xdate-june) that it may be unable to meet its debt obligations if the ceiling is not raised by June 1.

Only one other country has a debt ceiling: [Denmark](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64878254). However, two key factors create a less fraught situation for Danes. First, the nations politics are less polarized as there are 16 parties in the Danish parliament, and for over a century no party has had enough representatives to rule entirely on its own. Second, Denmarks debt was about 14% of its ceiling in 2021 - a result that reflects both the nations budget surplus and the nations high debt ceiling ($284bn) relative to its size, an [intentional](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/09/business/us-debt-ceiling-denmark-global-comparison/index.html) decision.

#Republican demands

###Cut social safety nets

The Republicans most enduring requirement for ending the hostage situation is imposing strict work requirements for social safety net programs like Medicaid,  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps), and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). The [proposed cuts](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/26/politics/work-requirements-food-stamps-medicaid-debt-ceiling/index.html) would push the lowest income Americansincluding people over 50, single parents, and childreninto more dire financial straits.

* Raise the work requirement age for food stamps from 49 to 55 years old: Under the GOP proposal, childless, able-bodied adults ages 18 to 55 must be employed at least 20 hours a week to receive food stamps. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 275,000 people, on average, would lose benefits each month because they fail to meet the requirement. 

* Institute a work requirement for Medicaid: Republicans are pushing to mandate that able-bodied adults ages 19 to 55 who dont have children must work at least 80 hours a month to receive Medicaid coverage. The provision would result in about 1.5 million adults, on average, losing federal funding for their Medicaid coverage (though about 900,000 would remain enrolled with their state picking up the tab).

* Restrict the ability of states to offer temporary cash assistance to low-income families: Through a complicated set of changes, Republicans propose limiting the money that states can provide to families with very low incomes through TANF. The program already has a work requirement unless an individual is exempt (due to disability or a newborn child, for example). According to [Columbia University](https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/publication/costs-of-cutting-tanf), the GOPs changes to TANF would not only hurt low-income families, but it could also result in economic and societal costs&as high as $29.6 billion per year.

###Cut other social programs

Republicans want to [cut](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-mccarthys-friday-debt-ceiling-meeting-postponed-white-house-says-2023-05-11/) 2024 discretionary spending to the level of fiscal year 2022, resulting in a cut of at least 22% for essential programs. This would be [disastrous](https://democrats-appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/delauro-receives-biden-administration-responses-highlighting-impacts-of-proposed)  80,000 people would not be able to attend college; 200,000 children would get kicked off Head Start; 100,000 families would lose child care; 1.2 million people would be removed from the Women, Infants and Children Nutrition Program (WIC); 640,000 families would lose access to rental assistance and more than 430,000 low-income families would be evicted.

#End student loan relief

Some GOP lawmakers are pushing to block Bidens student debt relief program as a condition for lifting the debt ceiling. Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN) [appeared](https://twitter.com/SenatorHagerty/status/1658585616416923648?s=20) on Fox Business to call for negotiators to end the unconstitutional program, which provides $20,000 of relief to qualified borrowers if they received a Pell Grant and $10,000 if they did not. The Republican blueprint for raising the debt ceiling, which passed the House with [all but four](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023199) GOP votes, prohibits Biden from enacting the program, in exchange for raising the ceiling for one year.

###Bring back Trump border policies

Other Republicans [want](https://www.politico.com/minutes/congress/05-12-2023/tying-border-to-debt/) their [draconian](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-05-21/la-ed-border-security-bill) immigration policies, reflected in the so-called Secure the Border Act, to be part of the requirements to raise the debt ceiling:

&gt;Key GOP lawmakers are signaling they want border policies in the mix as congressional leadership and the White House try to negotiate a debt ceiling deal, the day after Republicans passed a sweeping border and immigration bill. It was a GOP wishlist that included restarting construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall and placing new restrictions on asylum seekers.

&gt;We passed the bill that I think does the job. & And by the way, I think this is now a central part of any debt ceiling or spending debate for the remainder of the year, Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said in an interview on Friday.

---

#The hypocrisy

It is important to note that Republicans had no issue with raising the debt ceiling [three times](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/gop-debt-ceiling-trump-presidency/) under President Donald Trump. They did so while also passing massive tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, [contributing](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-added-about-3-9-trillion-to-deficits-so-far-budget-group-says-11599669921) to a $3.9 trillion increase to the fiscal deficit through 2026 under Trumps watch. 

Undoing those tax cuts and actually increasing taxes on the rich and corporations would be a guaranteed way to reduce the deficitwhich Republicans claim they want to do. Biden has proposed a moderate compromise, only partly reversing the Trump tax cuts by [raising](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/11/show-me-the-money-the-highest-revenue-raising-taxes-in-bidens-proposed-budget.html) the corporate income tax to 28% from the current 21%, still below the pre-Trump 35% rate. Over the next decade, this would result in $1.326 trillion revenue. Biden also wants to institute a minimum 25% tax on American households worth over $100 million, which would bring in $436.61 billion over 10 years. A variety of other tax changes for the wealthy, like increasing the top payroll tax rate to 39.6% (for Americans making more than $400,000 a year) and raising the stock buyback tax, would result in another trillion dollars of revenue over a decade.

For comparison, imposing stricter work requirements on Medicaid, food stamps, and TANF would only [save](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/cbo-scores-limit-save-grow-act) $120 billion over the next ten years.

Meanwhile, one area that Republicans want increased spending is already rife with price gouging, according to a [new report](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pentagon-budget-price-gouging-military-contractors-60-minutes-2023-05-21/). Bidens proposed 2024 defense budget is $886 billion, a 3.3% increase from last year and the [largest](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/10/biden-pentagon-budget-debt-ceiling-00082302) Pentagon budget in history. Yet, it is still not high enough for GOP lawmakers, who [called](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/budget/2023/03/10/gop-blasts-inadequate-biden-defense-budget-as-it-vows-spending-cuts/) it woefully inadequate.

&gt;A budget that proposes to increase non-defense spending at more than twice the rate of defense is absurd, House Armed Services Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., said in a statement on Thursday. The Presidents incredibly misplaced priorities send all the wrong messages to our adversaries.

&gt;The top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Roger Wicker of Mississippi, called the budget request woefully inadequate. And the chairman of the House Appropriations Committees defense panel, Ken Calvert, R-Calif., accused President Joe Biden of prioritizing misguided domestic spending and partisan priorities over our warfighting needs amid rising global threats.","Keep_Track",49,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/13rmq27/republicans_hold_the_economy_hostage_in_order_to/"

I know some are panicking about Trump potentially winning and thats understandable, but if he doubles down on banning abortion like the other GOP candidates have, its going to hurt him at the ballot box big time. In 2019 when his policies began to kick in, he promised to ban late term abortion and the next year he ended up losing in most of the states he carried in 2016. 

A couple weeks ago, we saw in Virginia and Ohio that if abortion is on the ballot, its more than likely going to tip the scales in favor of the Democrats. Some of the swing states that Biden won in 2020 like AZ, PA, and NV have put it on the ballot, so with increased voter turnout from young people like we saw in Ohio and Virginia, its very likely that he carries those states again. 

Again, this doesnt mean we should get comfortable, but theres nothing wrong with being optimistic. The most important thing you can do is get out and vote.","democrats",48,"https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/1811cxz/if_theres_one_thing_thats_going_to_boost_young/"

The GOP/MAGA has slid into a cesspool of its own making. With every opportunity it demands violence against its perceived opponents up to the point of calling for actual murder.

Of course, they are following Trump's lead. In order to ingratiate themselves with the madman -- a man who has called for the execution of a United States Army General, who has called for peaceful protestors to be shot down in the street like rabid dogs, who has called for the shooting of immigrant families, who has called for the shooting of petty criminals, and who has encouraged evangelical pastors to call for the murder of his political opponents.

They praise a man who has openly supports traitors to our country, treasonous scum who tried to overthrow our legitimate government, who has good words for international dictators, and who through his inaction played down the threat of a terrible disease for political purposes alone by calling Covid a Democrat hoax, was responsible for the deaths of untold tens of thousands of Americans; a man who openly aligns himself with Nazi sympathizers and racist organization across the country.

Trump/Gop/Maga present an impending threat to our democracy and are making every effort to turn us into murderous dictatorship.

Read this: italics mine.

""The GOP candidate for schools superintendent of North Carolina repeatedly dodged CNNs questions this week about alleged past tweets calling for *the execution of President Barack Obama* on pay-per-view, along with other violence against Democrats.

The encounter between the network and Michele Morrow started politely but quickly heated up.

Do you stand by comments about former President Obama that he should be executed? reporter Shimon Prokupecz asked, among several questions.

Morrow said no comment. She asked how Prokupecz knew that the tweets were hers but never denied them, despite multiple opportunities to do so. She also attempted to steer the conversation elsewhere by asking the reporter why he would be interested in North Carolina.

Everyone is so done with the gotcha moment, she said.

But Morrow has more than earned the scrutiny, according to the news network.

*I prefer a Pay Per View of him in front of the firing squad,* she allegedly wrote about the death of Obama, according to a post unearthed by CNNs KFILE. I do not want to waste another dime on supporting his life. We could make some money back from *televising his death.*

She also appeared to endorse the *death of Biden* in another alleged tweet, CNN reported.

The Republican lists her 16 years of homeschooling her children as part of her experience that would help her lead North Carolinas 1.4 million student school system and multibillion-dollar budget. She also allegedly tweeted that Satan was manipulating liberal lunatics and has said the pharmaceutical industry is out to *sterilize kids,* Fox 8 reported.

Morrow is a *conspiracy theorist* who has long espoused *anti-LGBTQ, anti-science and Islamophobic views,* HuffPost wrote previously.

Morrow will face Democrat Mo Green in November. I hope you will agree with me that we cannot allow this type of violence rhetoric into our schools through the top public education leadership position of our state, Green told ABC 11 in Raleigh.

4. Defines ""finished state"" as ""The frame or receiver shall be considered in a finished state when it is complete and ready to be used or is sold, for profit, and is marketed as able to be completed within one hour by a layperson using tools commonly possessed by a layperson."".   
States the Congressional authority is from the Second Amendment's protection of the right to keep and bear arms and the Commerce Clause. This specific definition is used to block ""80% receivers"", where the person needs to drill one hole, so we can say we are stopping ""ghost guns"", which will put pressure on Biden and Democrats since we are ""willing to compromise"".
5. States that private individuals are explicitly allowed to manufacture firearms for their own personal use and to perform in-person transfers of those firearms to members of their family, on the condition that they are not prohibited persons. States that no law be passed to regulate the sale or production of mills, lathes, 3D printers or other items which can be used to manufacture firearms.   
States the Congressional authority is from the Second Amendment's protection of the right to keep and bear arms. The law will state that Commerce Clause shall not be used to prevent a person from engaging the private manufacture of firearms nor shall it be used to prevent transfers, without compensation, to family members.
6. Changes the length a person is prohibited from possessing a firearm can only start once a person is arraigned and will extend for the maximum possible sentence after release from incarceration or parole. After that time, or if the person is found not guilty or the charges dropped, the rights will be automatically restored, and the person mailed a notice to their last known address.    
States the Congressional authority is from the Second Amendment's protection of the right to keep and bear arms. The Commerce Clause will also be referenced as this allows a person to resume engagement in interstate commerce.
7. Defines ""Engaged in the Business as a Dealer in Firearms"" as selling 12 or more firearms and/or completed frames or receivers in a calendar year, as defined as January 1st to January 1st.   
States the Congressional authority is from the Second Amendment's protection of the right to keep and bear arms and the Commerce Clause.
8. States that any person or business may sell firearm parts and accessories, other than a frame or receiver, with only the licensing and zoning required for business that deals in non-perishable general goods.

Edit:   
Three excellent ideas from a reply.   


1. Remove silencers from being NFA items and require them for hunting on federal lands and strongly encourage their use on non-federal lands. Provide funding for hunter education regarding silencers.
2. Remove handguns, rifles, and shotguns and ammunition for them as items regulated by ITAR. This allows companies to send small arms, information on how make them, and ammunition to friendly nations without having to wait for Congress to act. This maintains the security interest of not sending advanced weapons without Congressional approval.
3. Allow for the Defense Logisitics Agency to dispose of equipment by sending it to nations that are members of NATO or the NATO Partnership for Peace program. It will also allow NATO and PfP members to reexport equipment of American origin or design to other NATO and PfP members.   
Both Ukraine and Russia are PfP members, giving us the ability to give Ukraine our old stuff instead of crushing it or leaving it to rot in Arizona, and gives us a diplomatic lever with Russia as they might start playing nice to get that sweet American tech once they remember they are PfP member. It also lets us arm Russia in case it is discovered that Ukraine was the bad guy all along and Putin was right.

I also got another idea, since we really would prefer to end the mindless and useless bloodshed, instead of keeping it, **and the funding for it**, going.

1. Requires that America offer to be a neutral host to peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine and that negotiations be held in Alaska, due to its historic significance in American-Russian relations and our ability to maintain security for both diplomatic parties. Removes any travel bans, as needed, for diplomats and politicians to arrive and stay during negotiations. Also, its cold as fuck and they'll be more likely to want to get shit done and go home, instead of doing petty bullshit like diplomats like to do.
2. Requires that any peace agreement negotiated on American soil include one year of American occupation of Crimea followed by a vote, administrated by America and monitored by Russia, Ukraine, and the UN, to determine which nation Crimea is returned to or if they wish to become an independent nation. The results will be made public in English, Russian, and Ukrainian.
3. Upon the signing and ratification of a peace treaty by both sides, eliminates all sanctions on Russian nationals and industries made in response to the 2014 or 2022 invasions.
4. Requires that any peace agreement negotiated on American soil include a provision requiring Ukraine to ban symbols associated with the NSDAP, such as the wolfsangel, black sun, etc. and Ukrainian separatism, such as the red and black flags.
5. Requires that any peace agreement negotiated on American soil include an offer of NATO membership for Russia and a guarantee that America will vote for Russia's entry into NATO. Ending the Cold War once and for all will create an actual lasting peace.","progun",37,"https://www.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/18ualh1/this_is_the_best_time_to_twist_democrats_arms_for/"

J. Res. 44.** *If you are not a veteran, then we still need you to send [this link](https://forms.gunowners.org/form/veterans-against-the-pistol-brac) to someone who is!*

****

We all know that as of 12:00 AM June 1st, millions of Americans were made felons if they did not comply with ATFs pistol brace ban. And while GOA obtained an injunction protecting our own members, this there are millions of Americansincluding millions of wounded veteranswho are still not covered. 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are over 4.9 million veterans, or 27 percent of all veterans [with] a service-connected disability. 
Each of those veterans has a constitutionally protected right to a stabilizing brace on their firearmsbecause the Second Amendment protects all arms.

We need veterans to sign [this petition](https://forms.gunowners.org/form/veterans-against-the-pistol-brac) to Congress to bring to the House floor for a vote, Rep. Clydes H.J. Res. 44 to reverse the ATF rule immediately!

GOA will hand deliver this letter to Congress on behalf of every veteran who signs.  The letter says:

&gt;Congress must repeal the unconstitutional and discriminatory pistol brace ban by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) that hurts our nations disabled population, especially Americas disabled veterans who sacrificed their bodies to defend our nation. Therefore, we, the undersigned veterans, urge Congress to use the Congressional Review Act to reverse the ATF rule immediately.

**For some Members of Congress who squish out on Second Amendment issues all the time, hearing from veterans who support pistol braces might be just what tips them over the edge to vote for H. J. Res. 44.**

So if you are a vet, please [sign here](https://forms.gunowners.org/form/veterans-against-the-pistol-brac). And if you know a veteran, please send her or him [this link](https://forms.gunowners.org/form/veterans-against-the-pistol-brac) so they can sign too! 

Pistol braces were originally designed and intended to help wounded combat veterans have access to the best self-defense tools on the market. Thats why the letter reminds Congress:

&gt;For many disabled veterans, pistol braces may be the only means to safely and effectively exercise the right to keep and bear arms and to defend themselves and their loved ones. Alex Bosco of SB Tactical first invented the pistol stabilizing brace for his frienda wounded veteran.

And on June 1st, President Biden took that away.

**That is the message that key Members of Congress needs to hear!**

If you are a veteran or know someone who is a veteran, please [sign this petition](https://forms.gunowners.org/form/veterans-against-the-pistol-brac) to add your name to GOAs letter to Congress demanding that they reverse the ATFs unconstitutional ban!

Join with countless other veterans and tell Congress to:

&gt;1. Protect the right of those who have served the People to keep their firearms. 

&gt;2. Oppose this executive overreach by the ATF. 

&gt;3. Stand up for wounded veterans and the constitutionally protected rights they fought to protect.

&gt;4. Immediately and completely repeal ofthe ATF pistol brace ban that hurts our nations veterans.

And **if youre not a veteran, I hope you understand what a powerful message that is for Congress to hear.** *If you know any veterans, please urge them to sign this letter to Congress as well.*

To all who served, thank you. 

And to all gun rights activists who take action, thank you for standing with Gun Owners of America.","progun",27,"https://www.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/142yf9y/military_veterans_could_be_the_key_to_stopping/"

#Gerrymandered into power

Two of the nations most purple states, with a voting population split nearly 50/50 between the two parties, are also the most gerrymandered to produce a Republican advantage. North Carolina voted for Donald Trump in 2020 by just 1.3% (or 74,000 votes) and has a split state government (with a Democratic governor and Republican legislature), yet the Senate is controlled by Republicans 30-20 and the General Assembly is 72 Republicans and 48 Democrats. 

Wisconsin voted for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election by just 0.6% (or roughly 20,000 votes), but its congressional delegation is 6 Republicans and 2 Democrats, its Senate is 22 Republicans and 11 Democrats, and its Assembly is 64 Republicans and 35 Democrats. Like North Carolina, Wisconsin also has a split government with a Democratic governor and a Republican-controlled legislature.

* Note that Republicans now have a supermajority in both chambers in North Carolina, after Democrat Tricia Cotham [switched parties](https://news.yahoo.com/turns-rep-tricia-cotham-north-170000213.html) just months after her election to the General Assembly. Wisconsin Republicans also have a new supermajority in the Senate with a special election [win](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/05/wisconsin-senate-supermajority-impeachment-power) in April, giving them the power to impeach officials. Republicans in the Assembly are just two seats away from likewise having a supermajority.

Now, Republicans are using their unfair numerical advantage in both states to consolidate their power through the impeachment of Democratic justices on their respective Supreme Courts.

#North Carolina

Last year, Republicans reclaimed a majority of the North Carolina Supreme Court, flipping the bench from 4-3 Democratic control to a 5-2 Republican majority. Only about half of the states registered voters participated in the [election](https://ballotpedia.org/Supreme_Court_of_North_Carolina), choosing Republican Richard Dietz over Democratic incumbent Lucy Inman and Republican Trey Allen over Democratic incumbent Sam Ervin IV. In each race, roughly 200,000 peopleor 5% of the total votesdetermined the outcome.

* Both [Dietz](https://fedsoc.org/contributors/richard-dietz) and [Allen](https://fedsoc.org/contributors/trey-allen-1) are listed as contributors to the Federalist Society.

###Background

The conservative effort to capture the state Supreme Court began in 2010 when the Republican party won control over both the Senate and House for the first time in over a century. Then, in 2012, Republican Pat McCrory [defeated](https://ballotpedia.org/Pat_McCrory) Democratic candidate Walter Dalton to secure the governorship, becoming the first Republican to take the seat in 20 years. With their new trifecta, North Carolina Republicans [passed](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nc-campaign-finance_b_3660472) a bill in 2013 to terminate the states pioneering public financing for judicial elections, which, according to a [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X15599839) published in American Politics Research, led justices to be more impartial and less responsive to donor interests.

* The GOP also passed [other bills](https://www.wral.com/voting-changes-head-to-governor/12703982/) in 2013 to limit early voting, implement voter ID requirements, and ban same-day registration. They used their newfound power to [create](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/north-carolina-gerrymandering/527592/) congressional maps that diluted Black voting power so obviously, even U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas had to vote in favor of invalidating the districts. A different court case resulted in several state legislative districts being declared racial gerrymanders, as well. The Republican-controlled legislature then voted to [cancel](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article155062009.html) a special session called by Gov. Cooper to redraw the maps, saying that redistricting did not satisfy the extraordinary circumstances requirement of the state constitution.

In 2016, North Carolina voters elected Democrat Roy Cooper to be governor and [ousted](https://ballotpedia.org/North_Carolina_Supreme_Court_elections,_2016) Republican-affiliated Supreme Court Justice Robert Edmunds in favor of Democratic-affiliated Judge Michael Morgan, flipping the court from 4-3 conservative-leaning to 4-3 liberal-leaning control. 


Crucially, however, judicial elections up until that point were non-partisanthe candidates' party affiliation was not listed on the ballot. That all changed in the few short months between the election and when Cooper took office. Republicans convened an emergency session of the legislature and, with Gov. McCrory (R) in power for just weeks longer, [passed](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article121449157.html) a law requiring judicial candidates to display their party affiliation on the ballot.

&gt;It was a very sudden and brutal use of legislative power, [said](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/high-courts-high-stakes/battle-over-voting-north-carolina-supreme-court/) state Sen. Graig Meyer, who was a Democrat in the House in 2016 and voted against the changes.

&gt;Gov.-elect Roy Cooper, who wouldnt take office until 2017, was watching closely. They believed that if they could make judicial races partisan again, that they would have a much better opportunity to control the courts and inject right-wing politics into the judicial system, Cooper told Public Integrity this spring. And they have been successful.

* Republicans also used the last-minute special session to [restrict](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/north-carolinas-power-stripping-laws-mean-new-gov-roy-cooper) incoming-Gov. Coopers executive power and to give themselves more representatives on state and county elections boards.

Since implementing the requirement that judicial candidates display a party affiliation on the ballot, Republicans have won five of six contests.

&gt;Results from Burke County, North Carolina, [illustrate](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/high-courts-high-stakes/battle-over-voting-north-carolina-supreme-court/) the difference the party label makes. The area is the longtime home of the Ervin family, a Democratic political dynasty in the state. In the 2014 state Supreme Court race, without party labels, Sam Ervin IV received 62% of the Burke County vote.

&gt;When Ervin came up for re-election as an incumbent in 2022, his party affiliation appeared next to his name. In that election, he received just 34% of the vote in Burke County.

&gt;Ervin lost statewide in November, as did the Democrat running for another seat, flipping the court from a 4-3 Democratic majority to a 5-2 Republican one.

Using their new majority, the Republican justices [decided](https://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/412855.pdf) to rehear several voting rights cases decided just months earlier by the previously Democratic-led court. All five white Republican justices [overturned](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article274831436.html) their predecessors rulingspermitting extreme partisan gerrymanders, reinstating a restrictive photo ID law, and upholding the states felony disenfranchisement law. The two Democratic justices, both Black, dissented from each opinion, as well as the decision to rehear the cases in the first place:

&gt;Nothing has changed since we rendered our opinion in this case on 16
December 2022: The legal issues are the same; the evidence is the same; and the
controlling law is the same. The only thing that has changed is the political
composition of the Court. Now, approximately one month since this shift, the Court
has taken an extraordinary action: It is allowing rehearing without justification&

&gt;The consequences of this Courts orders are grave. The judiciarys authority
. . . depends in large measure on the publics willingness to respect and follow its
decisions. Williams-Yulee v. Florida. Bar, 575 U.S. 433, 446 (2015). The publics trust
in this Court, in turn, depends on the fragile confidence that our jurisprudence will not change with the tide of each election. Yet it took this Court just one month to send
a smoke signal to the public that our decisions are fleeting, and our precedent is only
as enduring as the terms of the justices who sit on the bench. The majority has
cloaked its power grab with a thin veil of mischaracterized legal authorities. I write
to make clear that the emperor has no clothes. Because this Courts decision today is
an affront to the jurisprudence of this State and to the citizens it has sworn an oath
to serve impartially, without favoritism to anyone or to the State, I dissent.

The justice who wrote that dissent is [Anita Earls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Earls), a former civil rights attorney who spent her career fighting discriminatory voting laws. In 2018, she won a seat on the North Carolina Supreme Courtthe only Democrat to do so since the partisan ballot change mentioned above. Her background, in addition to her well-reasoned [opinions](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/committees/death_penalty_representation/project_press/2020/summer/north-carolina-strikes-retro-application-of-rja-repeal/) on criminal justice reform issues and successful lawsuits against Republican gerrymanders, put her on a [short-list](https://apnews.com/3a36206929862d7c06293a5724eff2fd) to replace retiring U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyers. It also put her in the crosshairs of state Republicans seeking to silence dissent&

###Impeachment

Last month, Earls filed a federal [lawsuit](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/dwvkaelxovm/08292023earls.pdf) revealing the existence of a series of months-long intrusive investigations by the North Carolina Judicial Standards Commission seeking to stifle [her] free speech rights and potentially remove her from the bench. The Commission, overseen by Chief Justice Paul Newby (R), opened the investigation in response to an anonymous complaint about Earls comments on the lack of racial diversity in the states judicial system. 

Her statements, made during an interview with Law360 (reproduced in the lawsuit), were in response to a [study](https://www.ncbar.org/nc-lawyer/2023-05/diversity-and-the-north-carolina-supreme-court-a-look-at-the-advocates/) published by the North Carolina Bar Association that found 90% of the lawyers who argued before the Supreme Court were white and nearly 70% were male. She said, in part:

&gt;& For the term that just started in January & there were 14 or 15 law clerks
serving in our court and no African Americans. One Latina.

&gt;I think another part of this, in terms of the gender and race discrepancies that you see, I really do think implicit bias is at play.

&gt;There have been cases where I have felt very uncomfortable on the bench because I feel like my colleagues are unfairly cutting off a female advocate. We have so few people of color argue, but in one case there was a Black woman who argued in front of us and I felt like she was being attacked unfairly, not allowed to answer the question, interrupted. It's not uniform. It's not in every case. And so it could certainly factor in the politics of the particular case that's being argued.

&gt;So when that is the culture of our court  that is to say, when the culture is that male advocates and advocates who reflect the majority of the court, white advocates, when they get more respect, when they are treated better I think it filters into people's calculations about who should argue and who's likely to get the best reception and who can be the most persuasive.

&gt;I'm not suggesting that any of this is conscious, intentional, racial animus. But I do think that our court system, like any other court system, is made up of human beings and I believe the research that shows that we all have implicit biases.

The Commission alleged that Earls statements violated the Code of Judicial Conduct by suggest[ing] that another judge before whom litigants are appearing is making decisions based on some improper basis. Earls responded that none of [her] comments related to a decision in case (or the decision-making in arriving at
such a decision), but concern, at most, only decisions to interrupt advocates or fellow
justices at oral argument. Further, Earls argues in her lawsuit, [t]he Commissions continuing efforts to investigate and potentially discipline [her] are a blatant attempt to chill her First Amendment rights. 

Outside the technicalities of arguing federal law, one could allege that Republicansincluding those on the states highest courtare simply using the investigation as a pretense for removing Justice Earls from the bench and consolidating their power. The groundwork for their political gambit was laid years ago when Chief Justice Newby [defeated](https://ballotpedia.org/North_Carolina_Supreme_Court_elections,_2020) former Chief Justice Cheri Beasley (D) by 400 votes in 2020. Newby [fired](https://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/article261259762.html) the head of the Judicial Standards Commission, Carolyn Dubay, for the offense of reminding judges that, ethically, engaging in political campaigning outside of election years is a bad look. 

&gt;The memo advised judges to limit their political campaigning to the period when they are facing reelection. The idea is that too much politicking by judges undermines public confidence in the courts. This shouldnt be controversial, but it apparently upset some senior Republican judges who have no problem with judges also being politicians. Their displeasure with the memo was made clear to Dillon, a Republican who was appointed by Chief Justice Paul Newby to chair the commission. The March 11 memo was promptly replaced by an older, less specific version of judicial guidance&

&gt;The Republicans concern was that the advice offered by the memo would limit judges and justices free speech  including their ability to solicit donations and make endorsements  as Republicans seek to win elections, including taking control of the state Supreme Court this November.

Newby also [ousted](https://ncnewsline.com/2021/01/11/new-administrative-office-of-courts-director-replaced-top-employees-with-republican-loyalists-on-his-first-day/) McKinley Wooten, Jr., the director of the Administrative Office of the Courts and the first African American to serve in the position, filling his position with a Republican loyalist who immediately purged top senior employees. Their replacements included Trey Allen, a former clerk for Newby who is now a Republican Supreme Court justice himself, and the daughter of Republican Court of Appeals Judge Republican April Wood.

* The North Carolina legislature is currently [debating](https://www.theassemblync.com/politics/nc-senate-budget-2023/) a bill to set next years state budget, which just so happens to include a provision that increases the number of members on the Judicial Standards Commission appointed by legislative leaders (coincidentally, all are Republicans) and another that gives the Chief Justice, Newby, the power to specifically select which judges will hear lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of state lawswhich would cover redistricting.

#Wisconsin
 
In an April 2023 special election, the Wisconsin Supreme Court flipped from a Republican to a Democratic majority with the victory of Janet Protasiewicz. The race ended up being the [most expensive](https://www.wisdc.org/news/press-releases/139-press-release-2023/7390-wisconsin-supreme-court-race-cost-record-51m) judicial race in U.S. history, reflecting the importance of cases soon to be decided by the states highest court on issues like abortion rights and gerrymandering.

###Background

The high price tag also reflected the desperate effort of Republicans to keep their stranglehold on power in a state whose population is equally split between both parties. Until the 2010 election, Democrats always controlled at least one branch of state government, holding the Senate for 11 years between 1992-2010, the House for 5 years, and the governorship for 8 years. The [Tea Party movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement), based at least superficially on Libertarian ideals of small government (and general conservative opposition to the presidency of Barack Obama), ushered in a Republican trifecta in Wisconsin. And the timing could not have been more fortuitous, putting the GOP wholly in charge of redistricting for the first time in 40 years.

* Background reading: David Daley lays out in ""Ratf**ked: The True Story Behind the Secret Plan to Steal America's Democracy"" how Republican operatives like [Karl Rove](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2016/07/19/gerrymandering-republicans-redmap) teamed up with wealthy donors and corporations to target campaign money toward gaining control of state governments, where redistricting would take place.

Having gained control of state government in Wisconsin (and other swing states), the Republican State Leadership Committee worked with legislators to create new districts favorable to Republicans using sophisticated software like Maptitude. It was arguably the first time mapping software had been used on a widespread scale to gerrymander one party into power. The resulting Wisconsin maps, [created](https://www.wpr.org/wpr-reports/mappedout/political-powder-keg-2011-wisconsin-redistricting-passed-without-protest) in a secretive backroom process and passed into law after only one public hearing, kept Republicans in power of the legislature for the past 12 years.

&gt;[Harvard Law Review](https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1954-1961_Online.pdf): Republican leadership reviewed several drafts of regional maps
with the relevant partisan scores and chose drafts for each region. The drafters combined these selections to create the final map and performed additional partisan evaluations. The political science professor determined that Republicans would maintain a majority under any likely voting scenario. & In the 2012 election, Republicans won 60.6% of the assembly seats with just 48.6% of the statewide vote and, in the 2014 election, won 63.6% of the assembly seats with 52% of the vote.

The governor who signed the gerrymandered maps into law was Scott Walker (R), who was elected with the [assistance](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-17/scott-walker-is-king-of-kochworld) of the Koch brothers Americans for Prosperity. He then went on to eliminate collective bargaining for most Wisconsin public employees (except police, of course), enact right-to-work laws, cut [taxes](https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2018/03/19/which-taxpayers-saved-the-most-from-tax-cuts-under-gov-scott-walker/) for the wealthy, slash [funding](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/07/13/gov-scott-walker-savages-wisconsin-public-education-in-new-budget/) for public education, dramatically reduce [Planned Parenthood](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gov-scott-walker-signs-legislation-slashing-planned-parenthood-funding/) funding, and ban [abortion](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/wisconsin-abortion-20-weeks-not-legal-scott-walker-120370) after 20 weeks of pregnancy.

Walker eventually lost his re-election bid in 2018 to the states schools superintendent, Tony Evers (D). Just weeks before leaving office, Walker [signed](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/14/scott-walker-signs-lame-duck-bill-curbing-powers-his-successor/2238900002/) a package of bills created by the Republican legislature to limit the power of incoming-Gov. Evers administration. Among other provisions, the legislation revoked Evers control of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. board, gave the Republican-controlled legislature the power to block substantial changes to health care and public benefits programsin order to prevent Evers from loosening social safety net requirements, and allowed the legislature to intervene in lawsuits when state statutes are challenged and use private lawyers at taxpayer expense instead of the attorney general's office (to prevent incoming-Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul from pulling out of lawsuits challenging GOP policies).

The then-Republican Supreme Court ultimately [upheld](https://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-supreme-court-upholds-gop-backed-lame-duck-laws-limiting-power-governor-ag) the majority of the laws that limited the power of Evers and Kaul, though some lawsuits are still [ongoing](https://www.wpr.org/appeals-court-arguments-republican-lame-duck-law-attorney-general). In the intervening years, Republicans kept control of the Court by an alternating 5-2 and 4-3 majority, allowing conservative justices to continue to [chip away](https://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-supreme-court-rules-former-head-wisconsin-natural-resources-board-can-stay) at the Democratic administrations authority, ruling ballot [drop boxes](https://www.npr.org/2022/07/08/1100696685/wisconsin-supreme-court-ballot-drop-boxes-disability-assistance) unlawful, and restricting the power of state officials to institute disease-controlling [emergency measures](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/13/855782006/wisconsin-supreme-court-overturns-the-states-stay-at-home-order).

###Impeachment

Which brings us to April 2023, when Democratic-backed candidate Janet Protasiewicz [defeated](https://ballotpedia.org/Wisconsin_Supreme_Court_elections,_2023) former Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly, flipping the court to a 4-3 liberal majority for the first time in 15 years. The election was largely seen as a referendum on abortion, occurring less than a year after Wisconsins [1849 law](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/24/overturning-roe-sets-stage-wisconsins-1849-ban-take-effect/7703590001/) banning abortion in nearly all cases took effect. Protasiewicz [embraced](https://www.wispolitics.com/2023/protasiewiczs-first-tv-ads-focus-on-abortion/) a pro-choice position during her campaign, in sharp [contrast](https://pbswisconsin.org/news-item/kellys-work-for-anti-abortion-group-raised-in-2023-wisconsin-supreme-court-race/) to Kelly.

* The Wisconsin Supreme Court is likely to hear a pivotal case brought by AG Kaul challenging the states 174-year-old abortion ban. Dane County Judge Diane Schlipper [ruled](https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2023/07/07/dane-county-judge-allows-1849-abortion-case-to-move-forward/) this summer that the 1849 law applies only to feticide, not consensual abortions. This pre-Roe statute says nothing about abortion  there is no such thing as an 1849 Abortion Ban in Wisconsin, Schlipper wrote. Her ruling allowed Planned Parenthood to [resume](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/planned-parenthood-resumes-offering-abortions-wisconsin-after-year-103278233) offering abortions on Monday.

Protasiewicz also made redistricting a key part of her campaign, [calling](https://www.wpr.org/janet-protasiewicz-wisconsin-supreme-court-abortion-politics-democratic-campaign-issues) Republican-created maps rigged and suggesting that the way [Wisconsin] maps are configured right now, our democracy is at peril. While objectively trueWisconsins gerrymandered maps have the [worst partisan bias](https://www.wuwm.com/2022-05-09/report-wisconsin-legislature-maps-have-the-worst-partisan-bias-of-any-court-drawn-map-in-the-nation) of any court-adopted maps in the nationRepublicans have seized on her comments to demand that Protasiewicz recuse herself from upcoming [lawsuits](https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-redistricting-republicans-democrats-044fd026b8cade1bded8e37a1c40ffda) challenging Republican-drawn maps&or [face impeachment](https://www.wpr.org/assembly-speaker-robin-vos-calls-justice-janet-protasiewicz-recuse-cases).

&gt;""If there's any semblance of honor on the state Supreme Court left, you cannot have a person who runs for the court prejudging a case and being open about it, and then acting on the case as if you're an impartial observer,"" [Republican Assembly Speaker Robin] Vos told conservative host Meg Ellefson.

&gt;""I want to look and see, does she recuse herself on cases where she is prejudged? That to me is something that is at the oath of office and what she said she was going to do to uphold the Constitution. That, to me, is a serious offense.""

Speaker Robin Vos assembled a panel of three former Supreme Court justices to investigate impeachment criteria for a possible case against Protasiewicz. Vos did not name the justices on the panel, but the AP [reported](https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-supreme-court-impeachment-56516aad2371cb851ce0c8ae816a9c5c) that one of them is former Republican Justice David Prosserwho also happened to donate to Daniel Kelly, Protasiewiczs opponent, in a previous election. Another likely, but not confirmed, member of the panel is conservative Patience Roggensack.

&gt;Roggensack and Prosser voted to enact a rule allowing justices to sit on cases involving campaign donors. In 2017, a year after Prosser left the court, Roggensack voted to reject a call from 54 retired justices and judges to enact stricter recusal rules.

&gt;Roggensack, in 2020, sided with the conservative minority in a ruling that fell one vote short of overturning President Joe Bidens victory in the state. And she endorsed Dan Kelly, the conservative opponent to Protasiewicz in this years election. Prosser donated $500 to Kelly, who replaced Prosser on the court after he retired&There were numerous times during Prossers years on the court where he did not recuse himself from cases involving issues he had voted on as a member of the Legislature&

&gt;Prosser was also embroiled in one the courts most contentious periods in 2011, accused by a liberal justice of attempting to choke her. Impeachment was never raised as a possibility, even though police investigated but no charges were filed. The Wisconsin Judicial Commission recommended the court discipline him but nothing happened because the court lacked a quorum when three justices recused. In 2016, Prosser received $25,000 of in-kind contributions from the Wisconsin Republican Party. Less than three weeks later he resigned with nearly three years left on his term.


Two Wisconsin citizens who voted for Protasiewicz brought a lawsuit last week seeking to stop the Wisconsin Legislature from conducting impeachment proceedings against the Supreme Court justice. The plaintiffs [argue](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-09-11-mem-iso-emergeny-petition-for-original-action.pdf) that there is no basis to justify the permanent destruction of over one million people who voted for Protasiewicz. there is no factual finding of any crime or corruption to justify the impeachment of Protasiewicz under the state constitution.

&gt;In the case of Justice Protasiewicz, there is no factual finding of any crime or corruption. There certainly is no basis to justify the permanent destruction of the vote of the Petitioners and over one million valid Wisconsin electors. 

&gt;...the conduct of Justice Protasiewicz cannot be in any sense historically deemed as corrupt. Justices routinely do not recuse themselves from issues upon which they have expressed clear points of view or in the context of previous donors to their campaigns appearing before them as litigants. Thirteen years ago, this Court modified the Code of Judicial Conduct specifically to permit a Judge to not recuse herself from a case, even where a donation came from a litigant. SCR 60.04(7). Since, there were nine separate Wisconsin Supreme Court elections. Today, six of the seven Supreme Justices have received contributions during the campaigns from party committees. The Court is clear that statements by candidates on issues do not preclude their participation in hearing a case involving those issues.","Keep_Track",26,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/16mvp18/republicans_in_gerrymandered_swing_states_seek_to/"

The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) authorizes funding levels and provides authorities for the U.S. military and other critical defense priorities, ensuring U.S. troops have the training, equipment, and resources they need to carry out their missions. 

The House NDAA passed last week would authorize $874.2 billion in national defense spending, including $841.5 billion for the Defense Department and $32.2 billion for national security programs within the Energy Department. It would also provide a 5.2 percent military pay increase. 

The final vote was 219-210, with all but four Democrats voting against it: Reps. Don Davis (D-NC), Jared Golden (D-ME), Perez (D-WA), and Vasquez (D-NM) voted for the NDAA despite numerous amendments that advance GOP culture war issues sure to doom the bill in the Senate (where Democratic support is required to reach the 60-vote threshold). Four Republicans, all members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, voted against final passage. In Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) [words](https://iqconnect.house.gov/iqextranet/view_newsletter.aspx?id=104569&amp;c=AZ05AB), the NDAA did not go far enough to rein in the Biden Administration's disastrous policies.

#Reproductive care

**Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-TX) introduced an [amendment](https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/06%2029%2023%20DOD%20Abortion%20Prohibition%20NDAA%20Amendment230629181110984.pdf) to prohibit the Defense Department from reimbursing personnel for travel expenses related to abortion services.** The policy, [announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3301006/dod-releases-policies-to-ensure-access-to-non-covered-reproductive-health-care/) earlier this year, was designed to make it easier for service members and their dependents to access reproductive health care after a slew of states banned or restricted abortion procedures.

The amendment passed 221-213, with only one DemocratRep. Henry Cuellar of Texasvoting in favor. Two Republicans, Reps. John Duarte (CA) and Brian Fitzpatrick (PA), opposed the measure.

In arguing for his amendment, Rep. Ronny Jackson accused the Department of Defense of illegally sidestepping the Supreme Courts Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade:

&gt;I urge all of my colleagues to vote in strong support of my amendment to repeal the Department of Defenses illegal and immoral abortion policy. In the wake of the Supreme Court's historic Dobbs decision, overturning Roe vs. Wade, the Biden administration immediately set out to sidestep the court's ruling and circumvent the law wherever possible. The Biden administration has encouraged every federal agency to create rules and adopt policies that not only expand abortion access but also leave American taxpayers on the hook to subsidize abortion services& It is the Biden administration who has sidestepped existing law and given the department permission to take this illegal action. This has left us with no choice but to take corrective measures and pass additional legislation. The days of the radical left ignoring the law and pushing their destructive social agenda in the military are done. I absolutely will not waver in my defense of the rule of law, therefore, ensuring that taxpayer money is not used to kill innocent babies and, in doing so, ensure that our military service members can focus on the jobs that they have in front of them and their families instead of being used for the political gain of the Biden administration.

Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill (NJ) spoke in opposition, pointing out that almost 50% of women in U.S. military service do not live/are not stationed in an area with access to abortion care:

&gt;I rise today in vehement opposition to the amendment proposed by Rep. Jackson. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to thank the troops and talk about honoring their sacrifice and that's all, frankly, empty words and broken promises if this amendment passes. This amendment puts servicewomen and military families' lives at risk by denying the basic right to travel for health care, no longer available where they are stationed. Now that Iowa passed anti-abortion restrictions, 46% of servicewomen do not have access to abortion care. This would enact a dangerous health care travel ban. Service members signed up to put their lives on the line for our freedoms, our national values, our constitutional rightsthey did not sign up to put their lives on the line or their spouse's lives on the line because they could not get access to basic care. I was an officer in the Navy. What I learned was that good leaders protect their squadron. They don't abandon them in favor of their own politics or agenda. How am I supposed to recommend to young girls in my district that they should attend a service academy like I did when we know this amendment would mean they would be signing away their right to basic health care? This makes our servicewomen pawns in their extreme agenda and is a stepping stone to larger bans, restrictions, and wholesale disregard for women's health care in America.

#Gender-affirming care

**Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-MT) introduced an [amendment](https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/ROSEND_103_xml230629105747484.pdf) to ban military health insurance and the Department of Defense from providing or covering gender-affirming treatment for transgender people.** The measure, Rosendale admitted on the floor, is a shortcut to banning transgender people from the U.S. military:

&gt;Gender reassignment surgery&and psychotherapy for gender dysphoria&does nothing to help our troops continue to be the most effective fighting force on Earth and is nothing but a distraction and waste of valuable taxpayer dollars. The government has no business funding these procedures on the taxpayers dime. The question that must be asked is whether having transgender individuals makes the United States a more lethal force and whether it helps recruit the best and most effective talent for the United States military  and the answer to that is a clear and resounding no.

&gt;A report commissioned by general Mattis found that service members with claims of gender dysphoria are 8 times more likely to attempt suicide than other service members. It also found that these individuals are nine times more likely to have negative mental health episodes than other service members. As Thomas Spore, a former army lieutenant general, put it: if those with gender dysphoria are at a much higher risk of suicide, crippling anxiety, or mental breakdowns than their peers, those serving next to them will be reluctant to rely on them. Permitting them to serve also violates the principle of not placing individuals at greater risk of injury in harms way. To summarize this: anything that does not contribute to making our fighting force the most effective fighting force on Earth is nothing more than a distraction and I will not ask the people of Montana or the United States to pay for it.

Democratic Rep. Adam Smith (WA), ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, argued that gender-affirming care should be treated like any other healthcare service members may need:

&gt;The ignorance contained in these comments is breathtaking. Transgender people who have normal regular health care are no more to likely commit suicide than anybody else. So basically, the statistics that he is showing, once someone identifies they are having a problem, theyre more likely to have a problem. That would be like saying we have identified that service members that complain of PTSD symptoms are more likely to commit suicide. The point is to get proper care for transgender people and you dont have these issues. It is the ignorance that has prevented them from getting that proper care&We need transgender people to serve in the military and this amendment should be defeated.

The amendment passed 222-211, with Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar (TX) voting in favor and Republican Rep. John Duarte (CA) voting in opposition.

**Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) introduced a similar [amendment](https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/NORMSC_019_xml230627122201937.pdf) to prohibit the Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP), a program for military family members with special needs, from providing gender-affirming treatment to minor dependent children.** After saying that people who dont know whether they are a man or woman should not be allowed to serve in the military, Norman suggested that providing gender-affirming treatment to military families is a distraction manufactured by the Biden administration:

&gt;Recently, the military has tried to politicize this valuable program for transgender procedure purposes. I almost think this administration is trying to use something insane like what we're having to do here to take the focus off the things that are happening to Americalike the invasion at the border, like crime in the streets, like an economy that's sinkingthat we are having to talk about this. But I'm glad to do it. Somebody has to stop it. For example, the last year the air force suggested using the EFMP for families who want to help their child transition. Representative Panetta introduced a bill to expand the EFMP to include transgender dependents and specifically list gender dysphoria as a quantifying medical need for the program. If you put this out to the everyday American, would they want their tax dollars used for this type of surgery? Would they want their tax dollarsby the way, spending money we don't havegoing to this? My amendment ensures that we reserve this valuable program for its original intent, to help families with special needs, and prohibits the use of the program for the provision of or referral for gender transition procedures, such as gender surgery or for medication. This amendment also prohibits the change of duty station simply for the purpose of providing a child with easier access to these procedures.

Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (TX) pushed back on Normans arguments:

&gt;Families care about their children. And it stuns me that the gentleman on the other side has indicated that he wants to take health decisions out of the hands of parents who are serving in the United States military, committed to laying their life down for Americans, and eliminate it to the point that the parents who love the military must leave the military and diminish our fighting force. Let me be clear: As it relates to trans children in medical care, every major medical and mental health association in the United States, representing more than 1.3 million U.S. doctors, support age-appropriate gender-affirming care for transgender people. In addition, in the special needs of the soldiers and others in the United States military, there is no indication that money will be taken away from special needs children as it relates to the particular needs of trans children. What it does say is that parents who love their children would be discriminated against depending on what their health need is. And so I rise today in opposition to this ill-thought of and ill-fatedI hopeamendment that clearly divides us as Americans, as members of the United States military, and goes against science and medicine because this affirming medical care has been accepted.

Normans amendment passed 222-210, again with Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar (TX) voting in favor. Rep. Ken Buck (CO) was the only Republican to oppose the measure.

#Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

**Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) introduced an [amendment](https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/ROYTX_101_xml230629155250995.pdf) to eliminate [diversity, equity, and inclusion offices](https://diversity.defense.gov/) in the Department of Defense.** These offices focus not just on recruiting a diverse military force, but also on promoting a respectful culture within the military that values diversity and inclusion as readiness imperatives.

According to Roy, diversity programs make the U.S. military weaker. He argued the military is too broke to fund diversity positions and even cited Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts recent opinion against affirmative action:

&gt;The amendment that I'm offering, 310, amends section 904 to prohibit federal funds from being used to establish anything similar or any position comparable to the chief diversity officer or senior adviser for diversity and inclusion& The Department of Defense should be focused on one thing only: securing the defense of the nation. It's not in our national security interest to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for diversity training that continues to try to divvy us up by race. That is the opposite of the direction we should be going. In fact, it sews constant division into the Department of Defense. Does a person's race or skin color help them overcome hostile forces? Does it allow us to win the next battle? Do rainbow bullets and flags scare away foes? Yet, that's what we're spending our time on and we can't even pay our men and women in uniform. Literally the air force is saying sorry, we can't give you bonuses right now because they've mismanaged their budget and they're having to spend money on positions like this. China and our other enemies do not care about feelings. So why are we funding divisive programs and divisive positions rather than positions focused on advancing and training the strongest and best military in the world? That is the purpose of the amendment. It is great that we are eliminating in the bill the statutory requirement that we have such a position. But we ought to end this divvying us up by race. It is, in the words of the Chief Justice, a sordid business; To divvy us up by race rather than to ensure we have the best trained and finest fighting force in the world.

Democratic Rep. Adam Smith (WA), ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, pointed out that diversity, equity, and inclusion offices work to bring people into the military that were often excluded in the past:

&gt;I want to answer the most important question: what does this have to do with national security? It has to do with unit cohesion and with recruitment. And interestingly, the survey data shows almost three times as many people say they are worried about joining the military because of their concerns about discrimination as say that they're worried about the military being too woke. That is the point of this. The training is to make sure there is unit cohesion, number one, and number two, that we can recruit from the entire country. It really comes down to whether or not you believe that we have a history of discrimination against people of color, the LGBTQ community, and women. If you think that that just didn't happen, and we don't have to worry about it, then I guess this approach makes sense. But the history of our country tells a very different story. We need to address this in order to make sure that if you are a woman, if you're a black person, if you are trans or gay, the military is going to give you a fair shake. Let me remind everybody here, that just 13 years ago we finally allowed gay people to serve in the military. Every single republican voted against that. Every single one. Do we really think that our national security would be stronger if we drove all the gay people out of the military? We need all the resources, all the talents from this country, and regrettably we haven't always done that. What is shown: we need to address these issues. Now, the republicans exaggerate this. They act like this is all we do in recruitment. I've spent a lot of time with a lot of military people, this is not all we do in training the military. It is something that needs to be done to meet our recruitment goals.

Roys amendment passed 217-212, with Republican Reps. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (OR) and Brian Fitzpatrick (PA) joining all Democrats in opposition.

Another of Roys [amendments](https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/ROYTX_100_xml230629172333212.pdf) to ban Department of Defense schools from teaching critical race theory passed 227-201, with nine Democrats joining all Republicans to vote in favor: Reps. Jake Auchincloss (MA), Henry Cuellar (TX), Donald Davis (NC), Jared Golden (ME), Seth Moulton (MA), Wiley Nickel (NC), Chris Pappas (NH), Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (WA), and Kim Schrier (WA). 

**Rep. Eli Crane (R-AZ) introduced an [amendment](https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/CRANAZ_015_xml230630144539535.pdf) to ban the military from making participation in training or support for certain race-based concepts a requirement for hiring, promotion, or retention of individuals.** The measure refers to ideas that conservatives associate with critical race theory, such as teaching that an individual should feel discomfort&on account of his or her race.

&gt;Today I rise before you with a critical amendment that remedies the harm imposed by political and military leaders that emphasize social justice, progressive dogma, and climate issues against the dedicated men and women of our armed forces who joined to defend our country& What's divisive is how the military's becoming a political, a social experiment. I don't know about how many people over there or how many other people in this chamber served in the military, but I happened to join the Navy the week after 9/11. I can tell you this: I served with all sorts of people, from all over the country, multiple colors, and you know what? The people that I served with were there not because of what race they were. They were there because they passed the standards. They were there because they were the best of the best. And you know what? That made me feel really safe when we were going into the most dangerous parts of the world. And that's what we need to continue. We need to have a military that continues to be the strongest military in the world because of standards. Because the people that we have there are the best of the best. The military was never intended to be, you know, inclusive. Its strength is not its diversity. Its strength is its standards. Diversity can be a great thing but that should not be our focus. I'm going to tell you this right nowyou can keep playing around these games with diversity, equity and inclusion, but there are some real threats out there and if we keep messing around and we keep lowering our standards, it's not going to be good.

Then, in response to Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-OH)who once chaired the Congressional Black Caucustalking about the hardships people of color and women have historically faced in the military, Crane made headlines by using the term colored people on the House floor:

&gt;My amendment has nothing to do with whether or not colored people or black people or anybody can serve. It has nothing to do with any of that stuff.

Rep. Beatty asked the chair to strike Rep. Cranes words from the record, prompting Crane to try to amend his comments to people of color. Beatty insisted and the House struck Cranes words with unanimous consent. Ultimately, however, Cranes amendment was passed 214-210, with Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA) voting in opposition and Democratic Rep. Jared Golden (ME) voting in favor.

*Republican lawmakers in two states are on the verge of restricting direct democracy by increasing the threshold for voters to amend their constitutions. The GOP-controlled legislatures in Ohio and Missouri are days away from passing these extreme bills, spurred on by the fear that citizens are about to approve abortion rights protections. In other words, Republican lawmakers are trying to change the rules when public opinion appears to be against them and their harmful policies.*

#Ohio

Last month, Ohio Senate Republicans passed a bill to make it harder to amend the state constitution. Under [Senate Joint Resolution 2](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/135/sjr2), voters would have the opportunity in an August special election to decide if the state should require 60% of the vote to enact proposed amendments, instead of a simple majority. GOP lawmakers wanted to create a special election to determine the issue because, historically, fewer voters participate in special elections.

To accomplish this, Republicans [introduced](https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/04/20/in-gop-flip-august-special-election-will-return/) legislation to bring back August special elections just five months after [attempting](https://ohiohouse.gov/news/republican/hall-introduces-bill-to-eliminate-august-special-elections-107679) to abolish the events. August special elections are costly to taxpayers and fail to engage a meaningful amount of the electorate in the process. They should be eliminated from the elections calendar, Rep. Thomas Hall (R-Madison Township) said last year. But, last month, Republicans changed their minds about special elections&when used to subvert democracy.

&gt;Less than half a year after proclaiming August elections to be too expensive for the turnout they attract, the Senate Republican majority expanded the use of a special election this year, complete with $20 million in funding.

&gt;This is legislative whiplash, and we do it really well here in Columbus, said state Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid.

&gt;In a mostly party-line vote, [Senate Bill 92](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/135/sb92) was passed Wednesday [April 19th] by the body&With the approval of SB 92, August special elections will now be held for consideration of a General Assembly proposed constitutional amendment, to fill a congressional vacancy or hold a special primary for congressional party candidates.

Yesterday, the House passed SJR 2 in a 62-37 vote, over the [loud objections](https://twitter.com/jpelzer/status/1656358140282040320?s=20) of protestors at the state capitol. Democratic lawmakers even [joined](https://twitter.com/ErinInTheMorn/status/1656439486413193216?s=20) the protest, causing the Republican speaker to temporarily [shut down](https://twitter.com/HeartlandSignal/status/1656401727912812544?s=20) the session. The bill now heads back to the Senate for concurrence. 

The push to make it harder to amend the state constitution comes as pro-choice advocates collect signatures for a constitutional amendment on the November ballot to codify abortion rights. Opponents have launched a [$5 million](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/group-opposing-ohio-abortion-amendment-launches-5-million-ad-buy-rcna75088) ad campaign to defeat the measure, [falsely claiming](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/politics/ohio-politics/fact-check-ohio-abortion-amendment-says-nothing-about-transgender-or-parental-rights-contrary-to-ads-claims) that the amendment would allow sex changes for minors without parental consent.

&gt;Shortly after last November, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose and state Rep. Brian Stewart, both Republicans, [called](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/04/22/abortion-ohio-constitution-amendment/) for raising the threshold for passage of proposed amendments to the constitution to 60 percent&LaRose said the proposal was designed to help protect the Ohio Constitution from continued abuse by special interests and out-of-state activists. Later, Stewart said explicitly in a letter to fellow Republicans in the state House that the reason for the new proposal was because the left was trying to do an end run around us to put abortion rights into the state constitution and to give unelected liberals and allies on the state Supreme Court power to draw legislative districts.

---

#Missouri

Missouri House Republicans approved a bill to raise the threshold for constitutional amendments from a simple majority to 57%, in a race to beat a proposed abortion rights amendment heading to the ballot in 2024.

[House Joint Resolution 43](https://house.mo.gov/Bill.aspx?bill=HJR43&amp;year=2023&amp;code=R) passed the House on Tuesday in a 107-55 vote, with four Republicans (Rep. Mazzie Boyd [District 2], Rep. Bill Hardwick [District 121], Rep. Renee Reuter [District 112], and Rep. Brian H. Seitz [District 156]) joining all Democrats in opposition. 

Rep. Mike Henderson, who sponsored the legislation, [said](https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article275221416.html) that he is against the idea that a constitution is a living document. I just hope the constitution is something sacred, he said, adding it should not be an ever-growing document.

&gt;During debate, Democrats [cited](https://missouriindependent.com/2023/05/09/major-overhaul-of-initiative-process-one-step-from-missouri-ballot/) 30-year-old comments from former Gov. John Ashcroft, a Republican, on the sanctity of the initiative process and challenged what has been called ballot candy in the measure restating that only citizens can vote in Missouri.

&gt;The language, which would be the first item in the ballot description, is icing but when the rest of the product is bad, it doesnt become a cake, said Rep. David Tyson Smith, D-Columbia.

&gt;You just have dog poop with icing on it, Smith said.

The proposal now heads to the state Senate, which has only a few days left in the session to shore up support. If passed, Gov. Mike Parsons (R) may call a special election in the hopes of approving the new threshold before voters have a chance to [restore](https://apnews.com/article/abortion-missouri-constitution-voters-election-0d2fdde552c2478b283937a6fab78cfc) abortion rights in the state. Currently, all abortions are banned in Missouri, except for medical emergencies (which, we have seen, [requires](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/abortion-ban-exceptions-life-threatening-pregnancy-rcna36026) a pregnant person to be actively dying).

It is worth noting, as well, that the state constitutional amendment legalizing marijuana [passed](https://ballotpedia.org/Missouri_Amendment_3,_Marijuana_Legalization_Initiative_\(2022\)) with 53% of voter approvalbelow the threshold GOP lawmakers are now considering.","Keep_Track",23,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/13essui/republicans_in_missouri_and_ohio_are_making_it/"

#Iowa abortion ban

Iowa Republicans passed a ban on abortion at 6 weeks of pregnancy in the middle of the night Tuesday during a one day special session.

The bill, [House File 732](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=90&amp;ba=HF732), claims to ban abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected. However, there is [no actual heartbeat](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/09/02/1033727679/fetal-heartbeat-isnt-a-medical-term-but-its-still-used-in-laws-on-abortion) at 6 weeks of gestation because the heart of the embryo has not yet fully developed:

&gt;""At six weeks of gestation, those valves don't exist,"" she explains. ""The flickering that we're seeing on the ultrasound that early in the development of the pregnancy is actually electrical activity, and the sound that you 'hear' is actually manufactured by the ultrasound machine.""

&gt;That's why ""the term 'fetal heartbeat' is pretty misleading,"" says Dr. Jennifer Kerns, an OB-GYN and associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco.

&gt;""What we're really detecting is a grouping of cells that are initiating some electrical activity,"" she explains. ""In no way is this detecting a functional cardiovascular system or a functional heart.""

After a marathon session marked by [passionate protests](https://twitter.com/galenbacharier/status/1678762058882637825?s=20), nearly all Republicans in the state House and Senate voted to pass the bill. House Reps. Mark Cisneros (R-Muscatine) and Zach Dieken (R-Granville) joined all Democrats in opposition; Sen. Mike Klimesh (R-Spillville) was the lone Senate Republican to join Democrats in opposition in the final 11 p.m. vote.

The entire process lasted 15 hours, from introduction to final passage. Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) has [promised](https://governor.iowa.gov/press-release/2023-07-11/gov-reynolds-statement-special-session-protect-life) to sign the bill into law on Friday. 

&gt;Today, the Iowa legislature once again voted to protect life and end abortion at a heartbeat, with exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother. 

&gt;The Iowa Supreme Court questioned whether this legislature would pass the same law they did in 2018, and today they have a clear answer. The voices of Iowans and their democratically elected representatives cannot be ignored any longer, and justice for the unborn should not be delayed.  

&gt;As a pro-life Governor, I am also committed to continuing policies to support women in planning for motherhood, promote the importance of fatherhood, and encourage strong families. Our state and country will be stronger because of it. 

Absent from the governors statement is the fact that [over 60%](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2023/03/27/iowa-poll-most-iowans-back-legal-abortion-as-iowa-supreme-court-mulls-limits-roe-v-wade/69990037007/) of Iowans believe abortion should be legal in most or all cases.

A coalition of abortion providers and the ACLU [sued](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/uploads/filer_public/1c/b2/1cb240cd-4fbf-4b25-bebb-b9d8d54d6b1c/ia_hf_732_lawsuit_071223.pdf) to block the law on Wednesday.

#Nebraska illegal abortion charges

A Nebraskan mother and daughter pleaded guilty last week to facilitating an illegal abortion after Facebook turned over their chat messages to law enforcement.

Police first launched an [investigation](https://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/nebraska/norfolk-mother-and-daughter-accused-of-illegal-abortion-burning-and-burying-body/article_ff99fd49-a710-5ec3-8d51-5aced3001c71.html) into Jessica Burgess, 42, and Celeste Burgess, then 17 years old, last year when they received a tip that Celeste had miscarried and her mom helped bury the body. A Norfolk police detective obtained Celestes medical records, determined that she was approximately 23 weeks pregnant, and then confronted the pair.

&gt;When he interviewed them a few days later, they told him Celeste Burgess had unexpectedly given birth to her stillborn baby in the shower, in the early morning hours after midnight, court records say.

&gt;She woke her mother, and they put the babys body in a bag and stowed it in the back of their van, he wrote.

&gt;Later  the records dont say when  they drove a few miles north of town and buried the body, with help from a 22-year-old man.

After confirming the location of the body, the investigating officer, Ben McBride, served Meta with a [warrant](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zevd/this-is-the-data-facebook-gave-police-to-prosecute-a-teenager-for-abortion) seeking their Facebook messages. The evidence he found suggested that Jessica Burgess had obtained abortion pills for her daughter and gave her instructions on how to take them.

&gt;The Facebook messages appear to show Celeste and Jessica talking about taking abortion medication: 

&gt;Celeste: ""Are we starting it today?"" 

&gt;Jessica:  ""We can if u want the one will stop the hormones""

&gt;Celeste: ""Ok""

&gt;Jessica: ""Ya the 1 pill stops the hormones an rehn [sic] u gotta wait 24 HR 2 take the other""

&gt;Celeste: ""Ok""

&gt;Celeste: ""Remember we burn the evidence""

&gt;Facebook DMs obtained by law enforcement were then used as the main basis for a second search warrant, in which 13 laptops and smartphones were seized from the Burgesses; 24 gigabytes of data including images, messages, and web histories from their phones was extracted for the case.

&gt;""Celeste Burgess talks about how she can't wait to get this 'thing' out of her body and reaffirms it with Jessica Burgess that they will burn the evidence afterwards,"" McBride wrote in an affidavit requesting permission to seize the Burgess' electronics. ""I know from prior training and experience, and conversations with other seasoned criminal investigators, people involved in criminal activity frequently have conversations regarding their criminal activities through various social networking sites & computer hardware, software, and data are instrumentalities and evidence in the commission of this crime."" 

Jessica [pleaded](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/10/nebraska-mother-daughter-abortion-pills-burying-fetus-guilty) guilty to providing an abortion after 20 weeks of gestation, false reporting, and tampering with human skeletal remains. She faces up to two years in prison. Celeste was charged as an adult and pleaded guilty to removing, concealing, or abandoning a dead body, which also carries a sentence of up to two years in prison. 

At the time of Celestes abortion, the procedure was banned after 20 weeks gestation. Gov. Jim Pillen (R) [signed](https://apnews.com/article/transgender-health-care-abortion-ban-nebraska-1a88067bf403559116df7c09e004e472) a bill into law in May 2023 that bans abortion at 12 weeks.

#Idaho dissolves maternal death committee

Idaho is now the only state without a committee to examine maternal deaths related to pregnancy and make policy recommendations to improve outcomes. 

The committee, called a [Maternal Mortality Review Committee](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/maternal-mortality-review-committees) (MMRC), was made up of a family medicine physician, an OB-GYN, a midwife, a coroner, and a social worker.  It lost its legal status when the Republican-controlled state legislature [declined](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/news/2023-07-07/idaho-maternal-mortality-review-committee-dissolve) to advance legislation extending its mandate.

&gt;The legislation that established the MMRC gave members legal protection to review specific case information for maternal deaths and the authority to request records from health and law enforcement agencies.

&gt;A bill to extend the MMRC beyond its June sunset date was tabled in the state House Health and Welfare Committee this past legislative session.

&gt;Absent the statute, or the enabling legislation, the committee cant function in the same way, Elke Shaw-Tulloch, with the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, told Boise State Public Radio in May.

The MMRCs latest recommendations give a hint as to why Idaho Republicans were against the project: expanding postpartum Medicaid coverage, giving pregnant women priority for subsidized housing, increasing social services funding and support, and expanding access to the opioid overdose treatment naloxoneall traditionally associated with Democratic policies. 

Furthermore, Idaho has one of the [most extreme](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/idaho-most-extreme-anti-abortion-state-law-restricts-travel-rcna78225) abortion bans in the country, outlawing the procedure at all stages of pregnancy. A new report from the MMRC would potentially reveal how many more people died from pregnancy-related conditions since the ban took effect.

*Domestic terrorism motivated by right-wing ideology has been [on the rise](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/domestic-terrorism-data/) since 2015, coinciding with the candidacy of Donald Trump and increasingly inflammatory Republican rhetoric. The trend arguably peaked in January 2021 with the attack on the Capitol but the threat has not abated. With Trump running for president again and the GOP [becoming](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/opinion/mike-johnson-republican-party.html) more extreme than ever before, Americans need to be aware of the danger right-wing terrorism poses to citizens, democracy, and the justice system.*

*Below is a collection of recent right-wing threats. It is not comprehensive.*

##Threats to government officials

**An armed man was [arrested](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/10/05/wisconsin-gov-tony-evers-armed-attacker-arrested/71070595007/) after twice going to the Wisconsin Capitol demanding to see Gov. Tony Evers (D).** Joshua Pleasnick, 43, showed up at the security desk outside of the governors Capitol office with a holstered handgun and a leashed dog, demanding to speak to the governor. He was arrested and posted $500 bail. He then returned to the Capitol with a loaded AK-47 that night. Officers took Pleasnick into protective custody and hospitalized due to concerning statements he made to officers:

&gt;""While being interviewed Pleasnick said he would continue coming to the Capitol until he spoke to the Governor about domestic abuse towards men,"" a report obtained by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said. ""Pleasnick stated he did not own a vehicle and it is likely he has access to a large amount of weapons and is comfortable using them.""

**A January 6th insurrectionist was arrested outside of former President Obamas house in July.** Taylor Taranto, 37, of Washington state, showed up outside the Obama home with two guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. According to court documents, Taranto got the address from former President Trumps Truth Social post. He was allegedly [looking](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/judge-orders-jan-6-rioter-showed-obamas-home-detained-trial-rcna93411) for entrance points and tunnels between Tony Podestas house and the Obamas. 

Taranto was [charged](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/14/1187723433/taylor-taranto-jan-6-rioter-arrested-near-obamas-home-indicted) with two felony charges of carrying a pistol without a license and possession of a large-capacity ammunition feeding device, as well as four misdemeanors related to the January 6th insurrection.

**An armed Utah man was killed at his home by FBI agents attempting to serve an arrest warrant for making threats against President Biden.** Craig Deleeuw Robertson, 75, made numerous [online posts](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23904100/complaint-against-craig-deleeuw-robertson.pdf) featuring firearms accompanied by messages like death to Joe Biden and The time is right for a presidential assassination or two. First Joe then Kamala!!! in 2022. The FBI got an arrest warrant after Robertson posted, I hear Biden is coming to Utah. Digging out my old ghillie suit and cleaning the dust off the M24 sniper rifle. Welcome, Buffoon-in-chief, just three days before Biden was set to arrive in Salt Lake City on August 9, 2023.

According to an [eyewitness](https://www.deseret.com/2023/8/9/23826780/witnesses-fbi-kill-utah-man-threats-biden-social-media), FBI agents attempted to arrest Robertson but he refused to comply. Agents claim that after they breached the house, Robertson allegedly [pointed](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/4152473-fbi-utah-man-allegedly-pointed-357-at-agents-during-raid-over-threats-to-biden/) a .357 at law enforcement, and they opened fire, killing him. 

* Robertson also threatened New York County District Attorney Alvin Bragg, saying I want to stand over Bragg and put a nice hole in his forehead with my 9mm and watch him twitch as a drop of blood oozes from the hole as his life ebbs away to hell!!; New York Attorney General Letitia James, saying, Letitia James a snipers bullet does not recognize your qualified immunity b/tch; U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, posting Merrick Garland eradication tool with a picture of a firearm; and California Governor Gavin Newsom, saying, Another patriotic dream&Im standing over Gavin Newsom with a wound above his brow and my suppressed S&amp;W M&amp;P 9mm still smoking.

**A 19-year-old man repeatedly rammed a U-Haul truck into a barrier that protects the White House in May in an [effort](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/06/09/u-haul-white-house-attack-hearing/) to overthrow the government and replace it with an authoritarian regime fueled by Nazi ideology.** Sai Varshith Kandula, of Missouri, was originally [arrested](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/uspp/arrest-made-for-vehicle-striking-bollards-in-lafayette-park.htm) for assault with a dangerous weapon, reckless operation of a motor vehicle, destruction of federal property, and threatening to kill, kidnap, or inflict harm on the president. However, prosecutors filed only one charge, destruction of U.S. property in excess of $1,000, to hold him in jail.

A magistrate judge denied Kandula bond, saying he presented a threat to the community:

&gt;Kandula told investigators his plan was to get to the White House, seize power and be put in charge of the nation. He told them he would kill the president if thats what I have to do and would hurt anyone that would stand in my way.

&gt;Kandula told investigators he purchased the Nazi flag online because the Nazis have a great history. Kandula told them he looked up to Adolf Hitler and called him a strong leader and said he admired the Nazis authoritarian nature and support of eugenics.

&gt;Kandula also had a green book that detailed plans to harm family members and others, and contained the speech he was planning to give, according to court records. He said he had been working on his plan for six months.

##Threats to the judiciary

**A Texas woman was [charged](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txsd.1929656/gov.uscourts.txsd.1929656.1.0.pdf) with threatening to kill the federal judge overseeing Trumps trial for attempting to overturn the 2020 election.** Abigail Jo Shry, 43, left a threatening voicemail for Judge Tanya Chutkan on August 5, calling her a stupid slave n and threatening to kill her and her family if Trump doesnt get elected in 2024.

&gt;The callers introduction stated, Hey you stupid slave nigger, after which the caller threatened to kill anyone who went after former President Trump, including a direct threat to kill Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, all Democrats in Washington D.C. and all people in the LGBTQ community. The caller further stated, You are in our sights, we want to kill you, and We want to kill Sheila Jackson Lee. If Trump doesnt get elected in 2024, we are coming to kill you, so tread lightly, bitch. The caller continued with their threats, stating, You will be targeted personally, publicly, your family, all of it.

Shry, who had been [charged](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/she-sits-on-her-couch-daily-watching-the-news-while-drinking-too-many-beers-trump-supporter-accused-of-racist-threats-against-jan-6-judge-is-locked-up-ahead-of-trial/) with different instances of criminal mischief and misdemeanor threats in the past year, was ordered detained until her next hearing.

Trump has publicly [attacked](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-attacks-judge-in-2020-election-case-on-social-media) Chutkan, calling her highly partisan and very biased and unfair for past comments assigning him the blame for the January 6 insurrection.

**Chutkan isnt the only judge facing death threats for overseeing a case involving Donald Trump:** Judge Bruce Reinhart, a magistrate judge for the Southern District of Florida, has been a [target](https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy73pk/fbi-warrant-judge-reinhart-doxxed) on far-right social media platforms for signing off on the warrant to search Mar-a-Lago. 


&gt;Multiple members of these toxic online communities are even posting what appears to be Judge Bruce Reinharts home address, phone numbers, and names of his family members alongside threats of extreme violence.

&gt;This is the piece of shit judge who approved FBIs raid on Mar-a-Lago, a user wrote on the pro-Trump message board formerly known as TheDonald. I see a rope around his neck. [...]

&gt;In another post on the same message board, one user commented, Let's find out if he has children....where they go to school, where they live...EVERYTHING.

**Prosecutors who brought charges against Trump have also found themselves the subject of death threats:**

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought falsifying business records charges against Trump, twice [received](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/manhattan-da-alvin-bragg-sent-another-threatening-letter-white-powder-rcna79452) letters containing white powder and death threats. ALVIN: I AM GOING TO KILL YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!! the letter said.

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who brought state charges against Trump and his allies, received [150](https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2023/10/04/fani-willis-says-shes-received-150-personal-threats-last-2-months-following-trump-indictment/) personal threats in the two months following the indictments. One of the individuals responsible for leaving voicemails threatening violence to Willis was [indicted](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga/pr/alabama-man-indicted-threatening-fulton-county-district-attorney-and-sheriff-regarding) just last weekArthur Ray Hanson, 59, of Alabama, was charged with transmitting interstate threats to injure Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and Fulton County Sheriff Patrick Labat.

* Members of the grand jury that indicted Trump were also [targeted](https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2023/08/17/photos-addresses-said-be-georgia-grand-jurors-who-indicted-trump-posted-far-right-websites/).

New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is pursuing a civil fraud lawsuit against Trump, has also [received](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/13/tish-james-death-threats-trump-prosecution-00101699) death threats. Its rather unfortunate and Im very much concerned that individuals, lone wolfs, will obviously resort to violence, she said. 

##Threats to election officials

**Mark A. Rissi, 64, of Iowa, [received](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/man-sentenced-threatening-maricopa-county-election-official-and-then-attorney-general) a 2.5-year prison sentence for two counts of making interstate threats.** Rissi pleaded guilty to threatening to kill Maricopa County Board of Supervisors official Clint Hickman and then-Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich (R) over their defense of the legitimacy of the 2020 election.

&gt;Voicemail left by Rissi: Hello Mr. Hickman, I am glad that you are standing up for democracy and want to place your hand on the Bible and say that the election was honest and fair. I really appreciate that. When we come to lynch your stupid lying Commie [expletive], youll remember that you lied on the [expletive] Bible, you piece of [expletive]. Youre gonna die, you piece of [expletive]. Were going to hang you. Were going to hang you.

&gt;Voicemail left for Brnovich: This message is for Attorney General Mark Brnovich . . . . Im a victim of a crime. My family is a victim of a crime. My extended family is a victim of a crime. That crime was the theft of the 2020 election. The election that was fraudulent across the state of Arizona, that the Attorney General knows was fraudulent, that the Attorney General has images of the conspirators deleting election fraud data from the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors computer system.

**An Ohio man [pleaded guilty](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/man-pleads-guilty-making-threats-arizona-state-election-official) to sending a death threat to an election official with the Arizona Secretary of States Office during the states 2022 primary elections.** Joshua Russell, 44, was upset over the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump.

&gt;This message is for traitor [Victim-1s full name]. Youve drug your feet, youve done nothing, to protect our election for 2020.

Americas coming for you, and you will pay with your life, you communist [expletive] traitor [expletive].

**A Texas man was [sentenced](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndtx/pr/texas-man-who-threatened-elections-official-county-attorney-sentenced-3-12-years) to 3.5 years in prison for threats he made to Arizona officials on far-right social media platforms.** Frederick Francis Goltz, 52, pleaded guilty in April to interstate threatening communications targeting officials in Maricopa Countyone of the [centers](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-elections-arizona-phoenix-conspiracy-theories-d38321441bcd6cea58421f6871b4f74e) of Donald Trumps election fraud conspiracy theory.

&gt;In plea papers, Mr. Goltz admitted that on Nov. 21, 2022, he posted [Maricopa County Attorneys Office] lawyers name, purported home address, and purported telephone number on social media along with the sardonic comment, It would be a shame if someone got to [sic] this children. There are some crazies out there. This kind of info shouldnt be readily available on the internet.  On the same date, in response to another post referring to other Maricopa County officials, Mr. Goltz said, Someone needs to get these people AND their children. The children are the most important message to send.

&gt;Just two days later, according to court records, Mr. Goltz responded to a post about the elections official with the comment, Hes got a WIFE that is a lawyer, too. We need to find out her name and where she works. I dont think he has kids, but Im not 100% on that. When another user commented that kids should be off limits, Mr. Goltz responded by saying, NOTHING is off limits. Its people like you that are supposedly with us, who dont have the stomach to do what it takes to get our country back.

##Threats to schools and hospitals

Libs of TikTok is a Twitter account with 2.6 million followers run by a former Brooklyn real estate agent named Chaya Raichik. For nearly two years, Raichik has used the account to target the LGBTQ+ community, publishing slurs like groomer and pedophile, and spreading dangerous misinformation about gender-affirming care. 


As part of her hate campaign, Raichik [falsely accused](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2022/08/22/fact-check-false-claim-boston-hospitals-transgender-care/10340507002/) children's hospitals of abusing minors by providing gender-affirming care and [attacked](https://www.mediamatters.org/twitter/libs-tiktok-has-used-twitter-target-over-200-individual-teachers-schools-and-districts-2022) schools for supporting LGBTQ+ students. Her lies, boosted by rightwing media, resulted in numerous violent threats and months of harassment:

**Catherine Leavy of Massachusetts [pleaded](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/westfield-woman-pleads-guilty-making-hoax-bomb-threat-against-boston-childrens-hospital) guilty last month to making a false bomb threat to Boston Childrens Hospital** weeks after Libs of TikTok began posting misinformation about the centers transgender care program. In just four months last year, Boston Childrens was [targeted](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/12/03/metro/boston-childrens-faced-months-death-threats-hate-mail-heres-how-staff-are-coping/) by four separate bomb threats.

**At least 24 hospitals and healthcare providers, including Boston Childrens, in 21 different states over 4 months were threatened and harassed as part of coordinated campaigns involving Libs of TikTok.** Accounts like Libs of TikTok engage in stochastic terrorism, waging violent hate and harassment campaigns, spreading lies, disinformation, and violence, while ignoring science, medicine, and research, a [report](https://hrc-prod-requests.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/HRCF-OnlineHarassmentOfflineViolence.pdf) by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation said. They sit safely behind their keyboards while transgender and non-binary people must live with the consequences of their violent rhetoric, and medical providers live in fear for the crime of supporting transgender and gender non-conforming people.

**During the first four months of 2022, Libs of TikTok [targeted](https://www.mediamatters.org/twitter/libs-tiktok-has-used-twitter-target-over-200-individual-teachers-schools-and-districts-2022) at least 222 schools, education organizations, or school system employees** for teaching about gender identity, honoring student pronouns, holding Pride events, and stocking libraries with books containing LGBTQ+ themes. Almost a [dozen](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvj5dq/schools-report-bomb-threats-following-libs-of-tiktok-anti-lgbtq-posts) schools received bomb threats after being attacked by Libs of TikTok, including most recently bomb threats in [Oakland](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/30/california-elementary-school-bomb-threat-libs-tiktok-extremist), CA, and [Tulsa](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/tusla-school-district-bomb-threats-libs-tiktok-1234814986/), OK.","Keep_Track",17,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/17u8lyl/rightwing_terrorism_in_2023_judiciary_election/"

#Tennessee

Tennessee made it more difficult for people convicted of felonies to restore their voting rights, creating what voting rights advocates call the most strenuous and confusing system in the nation.

###Background

Two residents of Tennessee who were convicted of felonies in other states but had their voting rights restored were denied the right to vote in Tennessee. Ernest Falls was convicted of a felony in 1987 in Virginia and had his voting rights restored by a grant of clemency from then-Gov. Ralph Northam. Arthur Bledsoe was convicted of a felony in North Carolina in 1996 and had his rights restored automatically, under state law, after completing his sentence. 

Both men moved to Tennessee and attempted to register to vote. According to Tennessee law, there are three ways for a person with an out-of-state felony conviction to have their voting rights restored in-state: [1] the governor or the other state may restore the individuals rights, allowing them to vote in-state, [2] legal mechanisms, like a provision automatically restoring rights upon sentence completion, of the other state may allow a person to vote in-state, [3] a person may meet criteria under Tennessee law to have their voting rights restored in-state.

&gt;Tenn. Code Ann. § 2-19-143(3): No person who has been convicted in another state of a crime or offense which would constitute an infamous crime under the laws of this state, regardless of the sentence imposed, shall be allowed to register to vote or vote at any election in this state unless such person has been pardoned or restored to the rights of citizenship by the governor or other appropriate authority of other such state, or the persons full rights of citizenship have otherwise been restored in accordance with the laws of such other state, or the law of this state./

Falls had his rights restored under the first pathway and Bledsoe had his rights restored under the second pathway. However, when registering to vote in Tennessee, the state denied their application, [saying](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/attorneygeneral/documents/ops/2020/op20-06.pdf) that people with out-of-state felony convictions must satisfy the criteria of all three pathways in order to vote in Tennesseenot just one. In other words, an individual must have had their voting rights restored in the state of their conviction AND meet all requirements for a person with an in-state conviction to have their voting rights restored (under section 40-29-202). In Tennessee that means an individual with a felony conviction must also pay all victim restitution, pay all court costs and fines, and be current in all child support obligationsa scheme called pay-to-vote.

###Court case

Falls and Bledsoe [sued](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Final-Complaint-Falls-v.-Goins.pdf), arguing that the Tennessee attorney generals office was erroneously denying their right to vote. The state supreme court ultimately [ruled](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/FALLS-Majority-Opinion-Filed.pdf) in favor of the state, finding that the word unless in § 2-19-143(3) (quoted above) means that the state does not *have to* acknowledge a persons voting rights were restored out-of-state. 

&gt;Accordingly, the text of section 2-19-143(3) that follows unless illustrates exceptions to the otherwise hardline rule that convicted infamous criminals are forbidden from voting or registering to vote. Nothing in the statute, however, leads us to conclude that compliance with an exception enumerated in that statute precludes the legislature from enacting further re-enfranchisement requirements in separate statutes. Rather, the statute reads as if compliance with one of the three section 2-19-143(3) exceptions provides for the possibility that a persons suffrage rights will be restored&Article I, section 5 does not mandate that the legislature provide convicted infamous criminals with a pathway or pathways to regain the right to vote.

Instead, the majority reasoned, an individual who was pardoned for an out-of-state felony conviction must also meet all the criteria for in-state voting rights restoration:

&gt;To comply with the first exception set forth in section 2-19-143(3), a person must be pardoned or restored to the rights of citizenship by the governor or other appropriate
authority of such other state. But, to regain the right of suffrage, that person must also
fulfill the requirements laid out in section 40-29-202. To comply with the second 2-19-143(3) exception, one must have full rights of citizenship & restored in accordance with the laws [of the state of prosecution]. To regain the right of suffrage, that person also must fulfill the requirements laid out in section 40-29-202. To comply with the third exception, one must comply with all of chapter 29 of the Tennessee Code, including sections 40-29-101 through -109. Yet, to regain the right of suffrage, that person must also fulfill the requirements laid out in section 40-29-202.

Judge Sharon Lee [dissented](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/FALLS-Separate-Opinion-Filed.pdf), writing that Mr. Falls voting rights were fully restored; he should not be denied his constitutional right to vote.

&gt;Adopted at different times, in different Titles of the Code, and for different purposes, section 40-29-202 and section 2-19-143 neither cross-reference the provisions of
the other nor indicate the sections should be read together. Had the General Assembly
intended to do so, it could easily have incorporated or referenced section 2-19-143 when later enacting section 40-29-202. Even though both statutes touch on voting, piggybacking the requirements of one onto the other stretches in pari materia construction beyond its proper scope.

###Impact

Tennessee already has one of the highest [felony disenfranchisement](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Locked-Out-2022-Estimates-of-People-Denied-Voting.pdf) rates in the nation, with more than 9% of the voting-age population unable to vote due to a conviction. Of the estimated disenfranchised population in Tennessee (over 471,000), nearly 174,000 are Black, accounting for more than 21% of the Black voting age population  likely the highest rate of Black disenfranchisement in the United States. The expansion of the pay-to-vote scheme to include out-of-state convictions will only increase the number of people unable to restore their voting rights.

&gt;Its very hard to get your restoration of citizenship - even harder than getting a certificate of restoration, [said](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/22/tennessee-toughens-voting-rules-for-people-with-felony-convictions) Blair Bowie, an attorney at the Campaign Legal Center who has been involved in a number of lawsuits challenging Tennessees rules around felon disenfranchisement, including the Falls case.

&gt;The new process is more difficult than the procedures that existed before the legislature created certificates of restoration in 2006 and it puts Tennessee in the bottom of the barrel on rights restoration as one of the only states with a fully discretionary process, alongside Mississippi and Virginia.

#Florida

The Florida Rights Restoration Coalition and several Florida citizens filed a federal lawsuit against Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and other state officials challenging the states disenfranchisement scheme and election police force.

###Background

In 2018, 65% of Florida voters approved [Amendment 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Florida_Amendment_4) to automatically restore the voting rights of people with felony convictions after they complete all terms of their sentence including parole or probation. Approximately 1.4 million Floridians, almost 7% of the state's population, would have had their right to vote restored.

About six months later, the Florida legislature passed [Senate Bill 7066](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2019/7066/BillText/er/PDF), adding a requirement that people with felony convictions pay all fines and fees in order to have their sentence considered complete. Gov. DeSantis signed the bill into law in June 2019, thereby adding a significant obstacle to voting rights restoration that the voters did not approve.

###Lawsuit

The plaintiffs [allege](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1-2023-07-19-complaint.pdf) that the state of Florida has created and perpetuated a bureaucratic morass that prevents people with prior felony convictions from voting, or even determining whether they are eligible to vote. In addition to adding the onerous pay-to-vote requirement, Gov. DeSantis and state officials have failed to create a system in which people seeking to restore their voting rights can determine if, and how much, money they may owe in fines, fees, and restitution.

&gt;Since the enactment of S.B. 7066, the Plaintiffs and other people with prior felony
convictions across Florida have been unable to determine their eligibility to vote because of administrative failings within the states executive branch caused by the Defendants acts and omissions. As detailed below, the Defendants have created and encouraged a chaotic and broken system that is incapable of collecting and assessing the necessary information, particularly data related to LFOs, to determine the voting eligibility of people with prior felony convictions. 

&gt;These failures go far beyond mere failure to locat[e] and provid[e] felons with the
facts necessary to determine whether they have completed their financial terms of sentence. As described below, the Defendants have failed to comply with the express provisions of S.B. 7066 and this failure has resulted in a free-for-all by which various Defendants (1) apply inconsistent and often incorrect legal analyses to (2) inaccurate information concerning whether people with prior felony convictions have completed their financial terms of sentence, in a complex labyrinth of misadministration that can only be described as so standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement.

For example, plaintiff Angel Sanchez was advised by his probation officer in 2014 that he had paid all financial obligations stemming from convictions in the 1990s. However, in 2020, the website for the Miami-Dade County Clerk of Court incorrectly indicated that he still owed money. After presenting records from the Florida Department of CorrectionsProbation Services indicating that he had actually overpaid his financial obligations, the Miami-Dade County Clerk of Court still refused to correct its records. Sanchez then sought and obtained an advisory opinion from the Department of Elections stating that it believes his rights were restored but implying that additional information could reverse its opinion. Mr. Sanchez understands that, under those circumstances, the advisory opinion he received from the Department of Elections may not protect him from prosecution, the lawsuit explains.

More than a year later, the Miami-Dade Clerk of Court began sending Sanchez letters accusing him of failing to pay his outstanding LFOs and threatening to suspend his drivers license and send the balance of his debt to a collections agency. 

&gt;The refusal of the Miami-Dade County Clerk of Court and the debt collections
agency to adjust its records to reflect Mr. Sanchezs LFO payments, the lack of communication among agencies within Floridas executive branch (all controlled by Defendant DeSantis), the caveated advisory opinion Mr. Sanchez received from the Department of Elections, and the August 2022 arrests by the FDLE have led Mr. Sanchez to fear that he may be arrested for exercising his fundamental right to vote, notwithstanding his good faith belief that he is entitled to vote under Amendment 4 and S.B. 7066&Mr. Sanchez believes he should not have to jeopardize his career prospects or live in a constant state of fear because he chooses to exercise his fundamental right to vote. 

To make matters worse, the lawsuit alleges, Gov. DeSantis then created the Office of Election Crimes and Security to intimidate people with prior convictions from voting.  

&gt;Faced with mounting public criticism and concern about the failures of the State of
Florida to properly verify the eligibility of prospective voters, the Defendants doubled down. Rather than take action to correct the problems they helped create, the Governor, Secretary of State, and FDLE Commissioner initiated a statewide law enforcement campaign to intimidate people with prior convictions from voting. This new initiative capitalized on and magnified the statewide fear and uncertainty among people with prior convictions by promoting the belief that criminal consequences would follow if they, even mistakenly and in good faith, voted when they were not eligible. As described below, this effort by the Defendants further intimidated and deterred people with prior convictions from voting and attempting to vote, including Plaintiffs Jones, Sanchez, Waite, and Walthour, and from urging and aiding and attempting to urge and aid others to vote, including FRRC.

20 people were [arrested](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/18/ron-desantis-voter-fraud-arrests-florida-00052753) for registering to vote when they were not eligible. Most, if not all, were led to believe that they were permitted to vote:

&gt;According to a former Supervisor of Elections in Leon County, the arrestees
included individuals who were told by a government official that they could vote. Moreover, [m]any, if not all, of them also received voter information cards from the state, bolstering their belief that they were eligible to vote. Still the election police criminalized these honest mistakes as voter fraud. Indeed, an investigation into alleged illegal voting by persons with prior felony convictions in Alachua County found that the arrestees were either told [by County election officials] or believed they were able to legally register and/or vote.

The lawsuit asks the court to declare Florida in violation of Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act, which protects against voter intimidation, as well as the First and 14th Amendments. Further, they request that the court order the state to establish a reliable state-wide database that allows individuals with prior felony convictions to determine if they have outstanding [financial obligations] and provides accurate information on when and how to make payments.","Keep_Track",14,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/15b6uiz/tennessee_intensifies_felony_disenfranchisement/"

##Louisiana

The 5th Circuit issued a writ of mandamus canceling a hearing to choose a new congressional map for Louisiana, after a lower court declared that the original unconstitutionally diluted Black residents votes.

**Background**

Gov. John Bel Edwards [vetoed](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/louisiana-republicans-override-governors-veto-enact-new-congressional-map-2022-03-31/) the map in March 2022 because, despite Black people making up one-third of the states population, Republican lawmakers only created one majority-Black district out of six in the U.S. House of Representatives. Voters and voting rights groups sued, winning at the district court level in June 2022. Judge Shelly Dick (Obama appointee) [wrote](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022-06-06-Ruling-And-Order-dckt-173_0.pdf) that the plaintiffs demonstrated that they will suffer an irreparable harm if voting takes place with the legislatures map. She ordered the state to create a new map that complies with the Voting Rights Act by not diluting Black citizens vote.

However, in June 2022 the U.S. Supreme Court put Dicks order on hold until it settled a similar redistricting case out of Alabama ([Allen v. Milligan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_v._Milligan)), forcing voters under the 2022 map for that years elections. After finding that Alabamas map was unconstitutional in June 2023, the Supreme Court [sent](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/26/politics/supreme-court-louisiana-congressional-redistricting/index.html) the Louisiana case back to the lower courts.

**Fifth Circuit**

Before Judge Dick could hold a hearing to begin the process of selecting a new, fair map for Louisiana, a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit intervened. Judge Edith Jones, an archconservative appointed by Reagan, and Judge James Ho, a member of the Federalist Society appointed by Trump, [ruled](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23996969/landry-ardoin.pdf) that Dick did not give the legislature enough time to come up with a substitute map:

&gt;Since 1966, the Supreme Court has repeatedly reminded lower federal
courts that if legislative districts are found to be unconstitutional, the elected body must usually be afforded an adequate opportunity to enact revised districts before the federal court steps in to assume that authority&[The district courts] action in rushing redistricting via a court-ordered map is a clear abuse of discretion for which there is no alternative means of appeal?

The legislature had over a year since the case was put on hold, and approximately 11 weeks after the hold was lifted to come up with a new map. Voting rights groups [argue](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/louisiana-5th-circuit-redistricting) that Louisiana is trying to run out the clock to lock in the 2022 mapswithout a second Black opportunity district, which would almost certainly elect an additional Democratic congresspersonfor yet another election next year.

* Note that this is Gov. Edwards last year in office due to term limitations. Far-right Republican and election denier Jeff Landry, currently Louisianas AG, [won](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/15/jeff-landry-louisiana-governor-trump) the election to succeed him last week. 

##Ohio

The saga of the convoluted Ohio redistricting process continues three years after the 2020 census without a fair map in place.

In the interest of brevity, well cover just a few key moments:

* 2018: Voters approved a [constitutional amendment](https://tinyurl.com/43e7b384) that prohibits the legislature from passing a congressional map that unduly favors or disfavors a political party or its incumbents. Should the legislature fail, the seven-member Ohio Redistricting Commission (made up of five Republicans and 2 Democrats) takes over drawing a new map.

* 2021: The GOP-controlled legislature [created](https://www.wdtn.com/news/ohio/governor-dewine-approves-new-congressional-maps/?nxsparam=1) congressional maps that guaranteed Republicans 10-12 of 15 seats despite only receiving 50-55% of the statewide vote. Voters filed a lawsuit challenging the map.

* 2022: The Ohio Supreme Court struck down the 2021 map, [writing](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2022-ohio-89-1.pdf) that it excessively and unwarrantedly favors the Republican Party and disfavors the Democratic Party. After the legislature failed to pass a new map, the Redistricting Commission enacted a revised map with the same partisan breakdown as the original. The Supreme Court again [struck it down](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022-ohio-2471-1.pdf) for being a partisan gerrymander that favored Republicans in violation of the Ohio Constitution and gave the legislature 30 days to pass a remedial map.

* 2023: Neither the legislature nor the Redistricting Commission enacted a new map. Maureen OConnor, the Republican chief justice who twice voted with the Democratic justices to strike down the states congressional map for partisan gerrymandering, retired. Gov. Mike DeWine (R) [appointed](https://www.cleveland.com/opinion/2023/03/gov-dewines-mistaken-choice-of-joe-deters-for-the-ohio-supreme-court-editorial.html) prosecutor Joseph Deters to fill the vacancy. Deters has no prior judicial experience but is a longtime friend of the governors son, another Supreme Court justice.

Last month, after more than a year of delay and obstruction from the Republican-controlled Commission and legislature, the Ohio Supreme Court [dismissed](https://apnews.com/article/redistricting-ohio-maps-republican-election-gerrymandering-69f4f1b6852ba5ea1c7df80286cb38b1) all lawsuits against the 2022 congressional map. Voting rights groups asked the court to do so, saying the turmoil isnt in the best interest of Ohio voters. Instead, the organizations will focus on placing a new redistricting reform on the ballot in 2024.

The proposed amendment would replace the current Redistricting Commission, made up of partisan officials and lawmakers, with a 15-member citizen-led panel split equally between Republicans, Democrats, and independents. People who recently worked as politicians or lobbyists would not be allowed to serve on the Commission. On Thursday, the Ohio Ballot Board [approved](https://www.nbc4i.com/news/your-local-election-hq/group-can-now-collect-signatures-for-ohio-independent-redistricting-amendment/) the proposed amendment's language, allowing supporters to begin gathering signatures.

* Voting rights groups are [more likely](https://www.wvxu.org/politics/2023-10-12/analysis-voting-rights-groups-ohio-gop-legislative-district-maps) to continue legal challenges against the state legislative maps, which gives Republicans an advantage in 61 of 99 Ohio House Districts and 23 of 33 Ohio Senate districts.

##Wisconsin

State senate Republicans voted to block the confirmation of Wisconsin Elections Commission Joseph Czarnezki, a Democrat who tried to stop them from removing the nonpartisan elections administrator. 

**Background**

The Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) is a bipartisan panel, currently split 3-3 between Republicans and Democrats, that administers and enforces election laws in the state. In 2019, the Senate unanimously confirmed Meagan Wolfe for a four year term to lead the Commission. She lost the support of the Wisconsin Republican party during the fallout of the 2020 election for [pushing back](https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2023/09/14/embracing-election-denial-wisconsin-senate-republicans-vote-to-fire-chief-election-official/) against false claims that Donald Trump beat Joe Biden. Her detractors allege that policies like allowing the use of absentee ballots and easing voting restrictions during the pandemic rigged the election in Bidens favor.

Wolfes term came to an end in June 2023. The WEC could reappoint her to a new four year term with a majority vote and the consent of the state Senate. However, the Democratic appointees on the panel believed that the Republican-controlled Senate would have voted down her reappointment, requiring her to leave office. The three Democratic members therefore [abstained](https://www.cbs58.com/news/elections-commission-deadlocked-on-reappointing-wisconsins-top-election-official) from the vote to reappoint Wolfe and deadlocked the panel. Due to a past state Supreme Court [ruling](https://pbswisconsin.org/news-item/wisconsin-supreme-court-rules-prehn-can-stay-on-dnr-board/) that a GOP appointee could stay in his position past his term, until the Senate confirms a replacement, Wolfe likewise opted to remain in office as a holdover.

**War on the WEC**

Undeterred, the Wisconsin GOP [forced a vote](https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-senate-meagan-wolfe-elections-firing-62a0ec656530c740934b03083b3e3b11) on Wolfes appointment, saying that the WEC Democrats abstention equated to a unanimous 3-0 nomination. Last month, the Senate [voted](https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-senate-meagan-wolfe-elections-firing-62a0ec656530c740934b03083b3e3b11) 22-11 along party lines to fire Wolfe.

&gt;The Senates vote today to remove me is not a referendum on the job I do but rather a reaction to not achieving the political outcome they desire, Wolfe said. The political outcome they desired is to have someone in this position of their own choosing that would bend to those political pressures.

State law, however, requires four WEC votes for Wolfe to be reappointed. Without being reappointed, the Senate cannot legally hold a vote on her nomination. Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul immediately [sued](https://www.doj.state.wi.us/news-releases/attorney-general-kaul-announces-lawsuit-clarify-wec-administrator-meagan-wolfe-remains) Senate leaders, seeking an order declaring that Wolfe is a lawful holdover. Senate leaders, on the other hand, have introduced a resolution calling on the elections commission to appoint an interim administrator. Neither side has backed down and will likely wait for the courts to settle the disagreement.

Earlier this month, Republicans on the Senate elections committee [voted](https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2023/10/03/senate-election-committee-denies-appointment-of-dem-election-commissioner-over-administrator-vote/) to deny the appointment of Joseph Czarnezki, a Democrat, to the WEC in retaliation for abstaining from the Wolfe vote.

&gt;The only person to testify against Czarnezkis appointment in a public hearing also held Tuesday was former Menomonee Falls Village President Jefferson Davis, one of the states most prominent election deniers. Attending  the meeting with Davis was former state Rep. Timothy Ramthun, who ran for governor last year on a platform almost entirely based on stoking Republican fears of election fraud&

&gt;On Tuesday, the Senate Republicans on the committee said they were only voting against Czarnezkis appointment because of his abstention on the Wolfe vote. Sen. Dan Knodl (R-Germantown), the committee chair, called the abstention a dereliction of duty. 

Czarnezkis nomination still needs to be heard by the full Senate, where it is likely to fail. Gov. Evers retains the power to continue appointing Democratic former clerks to the positiona process that is faster than the Senates ability to vote down each nominee:

&gt;The governor can appoint faster than the Senate can fire and theres going to be a Democratic former clerk in this position that the governor appoints off of a list provided by the Democratic Party, so I certainly hope the full Senate will confirm Joe Czarnezki, [Democratic Sen. Mark] Spreitzer said. I think he makes a great Commissioner but if they choose to not confirm him, there will be another Democratic former clerk in this position.

&gt;Evers spokesperson Britt Cudaback wrote on Twitter Tuesday that if the full Senate votes to deny Czarnezki, there will be no daylight between that vote and when Evers names his replacement.","Keep_Track",13,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/179vc4y/republicans_continue_to_undermine_voting_rights/"
